# Reliability best practices in Azure Monitor

In the cloud, we acknowledge that failures happen. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component. Use the following information to monitor your virtual machines and their client workloads for failure.

This article describes [Reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/reliability/) for Azure Monitor as part of the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/). The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:

- Reliability
- Security
- Cost Optimization
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency
