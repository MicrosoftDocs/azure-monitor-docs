# Queries for the OEPAirFlowTask table

For information on using these queries in the Azure portal, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). For the REST API, see [Query](/rest/api/loganalytics/query).


### DAG type vs DAG runs summary statitics  


Number of DAG runs of each type of DAG type in the given time range  

```query
OEPAirFlowTask
| extend ResourceName = tostring(split(_ResourceId , '/')[-1])
// | where ResourceName == "<the name of ADME instance>"        // to filter on resourceName replace <...> and uncomment line
| distinct DagName, CorrelationId                               // correlationId is same as runId - we have created a duplicate for consistency in search across logs of all services 
| sort by DagName asc

```



### Correlation IDs of all DAG runs  


Correlation IDs of all the DAG runs that have occurred in the time range (for all DAG types)  

```query
OEPAirFlowTask
| extend ResourceName = tostring(split(_ResourceId , '/')[-1])
// | where ResourceName == "<the name of ADME instance>"        // to filter on resourceName replace <...> and uncomment line
| distinct DagName, CorrelationId                               // correlationId is same as runId - we have created a duplicate for consistency in search across logs of all services 
| summarize count() by DagName

```



### Logs of a DAG run  


Retrieves logs for a particular AirFlow DAG run given the correlationId and time range.  

```query
OEPAirFlowTask
| extend ResourceName = tostring(split(_ResourceId , '/')[-1])
// | where ResourceName == "<the name of ADME instance>"        // to filter on resourceName replace <...> and uncomment line
// | where CorrelationId == "<DAG run's runId>"                 // to filter on correlationID replace <...> with correlationId (same as runId) - we have created a duplicate for to maintain consistency of column name across all services 
| project TimeGenerated, DagName, LogLevel, DagTaskName, CodePath, Content

```



### Error logs of a DAG run  


Retrieves error logs for a particular AirFlow DAG run given the correlationId and time range.  

```query
OEPAirFlowTask
| extend ResourceName = tostring(split(_ResourceId , '/')[-1])
// | where ResourceName == "<the name of ADME instance>"        // to filter on resourceName replace <...> and uncomment line
// | where CorrelationId == "<DAG run's runId>"                 // to filter on correlationID replace <...> with correlationId (same as runId) - we have created a duplicate for to maintain consistency of column name across all services 
| where LogLevel  == "ERROR"
| project TimeGenerated, DagName, LogLevel, DagTaskName, CodePath, Content

```
