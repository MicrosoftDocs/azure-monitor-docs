| summarize count_per_type=count() by DataType
| sort by count_per_type desc
| render piechart
```



### Billable performance data  


Calculate the volume of billable data (in GB) for Perf data, over the last day.  

```query
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where IsBillable == true
| where DataType == "Perf"
| summarize TotalVolumeGB = sum(Quantity) / 1024
```



### Volume of solutions' data  


Chart the volume of data (in Mb) sent by each solution.  

```query
Usage
| summarize total_MBytes=sum(Quantity) by Solution
| sort by total_MBytes desc nulls last

```



### Total workspace ingestion over the last 24 hours  


Volume (GB) of all data ingested to this workspace, over the last 24 hours.  

```query
Usage
