### Log severity analysis  


Analyze log distribution by severity level and service over the last hour.  

```query
OTelLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize 
    LogCount = count(),
    UniqueTraces = dcount(TraceId),
    UniqueSpans = dcount(SpanId),
    SampleBodies = take_any(Body, 3)
    by ServiceName, SeverityText, SeverityNumber
| extend SeverityLevel = case(
    SeverityNumber <= 4, "Debug",
    SeverityNumber <= 8, "Info", 
    SeverityNumber <= 12, "Warn",
    SeverityNumber <= 16, "Error",
    "Fatal"
)
| order by SeverityNumber desc, LogCount desc
| project ServiceName, SeverityText, SeverityLevel, SeverityNumber, LogCount, UniqueTraces, UniqueSpans, SampleBodies
| limit 100
```
