### Chat operations  


Returns all distinct combinations of chat operation and version pairs.  

```query
ACSChatIncomingOperations
| distinct OperationName, OperationVersion 
| limit 100
```



### Calculate chat operation duration percentiles  


Calculates the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of run duration in milliseconds for each chat operation. It can be customized to be run for a single operation, or for other percentiles.  

```query
ACSChatIncomingOperations
// where OperationName == "<operation>" // This can be uncommented and specified to calculate only a single operation's duration percentiles
| summarize percentiles(DurationMs, 90, 95, 99) by OperationName, OperationVersion // calculate 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of each Operation
| limit 100
```



### Top 5 IP addresses per chat operation  


For every chat operation, fetch the 5 IP addresses that have called that operation the most.  

```query
ACSChatIncomingOperations
// | where OperationName == "<operation>" // This can be uncommented and specified to calculate only a single operation's count
| top-nested of OperationName by dummy=max(0), // For all the Operations...
  top-nested 5 of CallerIpAddress by count() // List the IP address that have called that operation the most
| project-away dummy // Remove dummy line from the result set
| limit 100
```



### Chat operational errors  


List every chat error ordered by recency.  

```query
ACSChatIncomingOperations
| where ResultType == "Failed"
| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, OperationVersion, ResultSignature, ResultDescription
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| limit 100
```



### Chat operation result counts  


For every chat operation, count the types of returned results.  

```query
ACSChatIncomingOperations
| summarize Count = count() by OperationName, ResultType //, ResultSignature // This can also be uncommented to determine the count of each ResultSignature for each ResultType 
| order by OperationName asc, Count desc
| limit 100
```
