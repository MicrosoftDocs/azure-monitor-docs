# Queries for the Update table

For information on using these queries in the Azure portal, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). For the REST API, see [Query](/rest/api/loganalytics/query).


### Missing security or critical updates  


Count how many security or other critical updates are missing.  

```query
// To create an alert for this query, click '+ New alert rule'
