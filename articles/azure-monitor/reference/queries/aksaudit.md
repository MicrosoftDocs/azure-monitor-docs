```query
AKSAudit
| where ResponseStatus.code != 401  // Exclude unauthorized responses
| mv-expand SourceIps               // Expand the list of SourceIp entries into individual rows
| summarize Count = count() by SourceIp = tostring(SourceIps), ResourceId = _ResourceId
| sort by Count desc
```
