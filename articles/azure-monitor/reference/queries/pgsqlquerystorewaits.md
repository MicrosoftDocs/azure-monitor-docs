# Queries for the PGSQLQueryStoreWaits table

For information on using these queries in the Azure portal, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). For the REST API, see [Query](/rest/api/loganalytics/query).


### Wait event trends  


Display wait event trends over time for all queries.  

```query
// By default, entries are aggregated in QueryStore Wait Sampling every 15 mins (see pg_qs.interval_length_minutes)
// AgregationWindow was set to 15min, but you may modify it based on your needs, however should not be less than pg_qs.interval_length_minutes. 
let AgregationWindow=15m;
PGSQLQueryStoreWaits
| where UserId !in (10,0) //excludes azure managed user and system calls
| where QueryId != 0  //excludes system calls, background workers and idle sessions
| project StartTime,EndTime, UserId, DatabaseId, QueryId, Calls, EventType, Event
| extend WaitEvent = iff(isempty(EventType), 'No Waits', strcat(EventType, ": ", Event))
| summarize sum(Calls) by WaitEvent, bin(EndTime,AgregationWindow)
| render columnchart
```



### Top wait events  


Identify top 10 wait events by queries.  

```query
// By default, entries are aggregated in QueryStore Wait Sampling every 15 mins (see pg_qs.interval_length_minutes)
// AgregationWindow was set to 15min, but you may modify it based on your needs, however should not be less than pg_qs.interval_length_minutes. 
let AgregationWindow=15m;
PGSQLQueryStoreWaits
| where UserId !in (10,0) //excludes azure managed user and system calls
| where QueryId != 0 // excludes system calls, background workers and idle sessions
| summarize sumSampledCalls=sum(Calls) by EventType, Event, QueryId, bin(EndTime,AgregationWindow)
| extend WaitEvent = iff(isempty(EventType), 'No Waits', strcat(EventType, ": ", Event))
| top 10 by sumSampledCalls desc 
```
