# Queries for the RetinaNetworkFlowLogs table

For information on using these queries in the Azure portal, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). For the REST API, see [Query](/rest/api/loganalytics/query).


### Dropped network low Logs  


Get all the network flow logs that were dropped.  

```query
RetinaNetworkFlowLogs
| where Verdict == "DROPPED"
| limit 100

```



### Top 10 network flow log metrics  


Get the network flow log metrics for the top 10 source and destination ips by total bytes sent and received.  

```query
let TopSourceIPs = 
    RetinaNetworkFlowLogs
    | summarize TotalPacketsSent = sum(PacketsSent) by SourceIP = IP.Source
    | extend MetricCategory = "Top Source IPs by Packets Sent"
    | project MetricCategory, Entity = SourceIP, Value = TotalPacketsSent
    | top 10 by Value desc;

let TopDestinationIPs = 
    RetinaNetworkFlowLogs
    | summarize TotalPacketsReceived = sum(PacketsReceived) by DestinationIP = IP.Destination
    | extend MetricCategory = "Top Destination IPs by Packets Received"
    | project MetricCategory, Entity = DestinationIP, Value = TotalPacketsReceived
    | top 10 by Value desc;

let TopSourceIPsByBytes = 
    RetinaNetworkFlowLogs
    | summarize TotalBytesSent = sum(BytesSent) by SourceIP = IP.Source
    | extend MetricCategory = "Top Source IPs by Bytes Sent"
    | project MetricCategory, Entity = SourceIP, Value = TotalBytesSent
    | top 10 by Value desc;

let TopDestinationIPsByBytes = 
    RetinaNetworkFlowLogs
    | summarize TotalBytesReceived = sum(BytesReceived) by DestinationIP = IP.Destination
    | extend MetricCategory = "Top Destination IPs by Bytes Received"
    | project MetricCategory, Entity = DestinationIP, Value = TotalBytesReceived
    | top 10 by Value desc;

let TopProtocols = 
    RetinaNetworkFlowLogs
    | summarize TotalUsage = count() by Protocol
    | extend MetricCategory = "Top Protocols by Usage"
    | project MetricCategory, Entity = Protocol, Value = TotalUsage
    | top 10 by Value desc;

TopSourceIPs
| union TopDestinationIPs
| union TopSourceIPsByBytes
| union TopDestinationIPsByBytes
| union TopProtocols
```
