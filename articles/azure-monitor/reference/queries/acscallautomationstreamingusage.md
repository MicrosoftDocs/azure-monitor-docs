### Media Streaming minutes  


Calculates the total number of streaming minutes of the MediaStreaming operation.  

```query
ACSCallAutomationStreamingUsage 
    | where StreamingModality contains "AudioStreaming" 
    | summarize TotalMinutesStreamed = sum(StreamingDurationInMs)/60000
```



### Media Streaming minutes per call  


Calculates the total number of streaming minutes of the MediaStreaming operation per call.  

```query
// Get total number of minutes of streams recorded per call. This will sum up all durations of streams in each call.
// For Media Streaming, Streams would be defined as and calculated per call as follows:
//  - Mixed MediaStreaming: Total number of minutes streamed in each session between a start request and stop request/call-end/error.
//      eg: if the streaming session was 10 minutes and there were 3 participants during the session, the stream length would be 10 minutes total.
//  - Unmixed MediaStreaming: Total number of minutes streamed in each session between a start request and stop request/call-end/error.
//      or joining and leaving events per participant in that session.
//          eg: if the streaming session was 10 minutes and there were 3 participants during the session, the stream length would be 3x10 = 30 minutes total.
ACSCallAutomationStreamingUsage
    | where StreamingModality contains "AudioStreaming"
    | summarize TotalMinutesStreamedPerCall = sum(StreamingDurationInMs)/60000 by CallConnectionId
```



### Media Streaming minutes per call per participant  


Calculates the total number of streaming minutes of the MediaStreaming operation per call per participant.  

```query
// Get total number of minutes of streams recorded per participant in each call. This applies only to the unmixed MediaStreaming cases.
// For Media Streaming, Streams would be defined as and calculated per call as follows:
//  - Unmixed MediaStreaming: Total number of minutes streamed in each session between a start request and stop request/call-end/error.
//      or joining and leaving events per participant in that session.
//      eg: In a single call,
//          if streaming session (1) was 10 minutes participant (a) and (b) were in that session;
//          if streaming session (2) was 05 minutes participant (b) and (c) were in that session;
//          if streaming session (3) was 07 minutes participant (a), (b) and (c) were in that session;
//          then the total minutes per participant would be: 
//              participant (a) = 17 minutes,
//              participant (b) = 22 minutes,
//              participant (c) = 12 minutes
