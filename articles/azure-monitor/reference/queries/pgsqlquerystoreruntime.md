# Queries for the PGSQLQueryStoreRuntime table

For information on using these queries in the Azure portal, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). For the REST API, see [Query](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview).


### Query execution exceeding a threshold  


Identify queries that take longer than the defined threshold.  

```query
// Please change the threshold in milliseconds upon your requirements
// By default, entries are aggregated every 15 mins (see pg_qs.interval_length_minutes)
// PlanId is captured only if pg_qs.store_query_plans=ON
let MinQueryExecutionThresholdInMilliseconds=1000;
PGSQLQueryStoreRuntime
| where IsSystemQuery==false //excludes azure managed user
| where MeanExecDurationMs > MinQueryExecutionThresholdInMilliseconds
| project
    StartTime,
    EndTime,
    QueryId,
    PlanId,
    QueryType,
    UserId,
    DatabaseId,
    MeanExecDurationMs,
    MaxExecDurationMs,
    Calls,
    Rows
| order by MeanExecDurationMs desc, QueryId asc
| limit 100
```



### Slowest queries  


Identify top 10 slowest queries by mean execution time.  

```query
// PlanId is captured only if pg_qs.store_query_plans=ON
PGSQLQueryStoreRuntime
| where IsSystemQuery==false //excludes azure managed user
| summarize AvgMeanExecDuration=avg(MeanExecDurationMs),MaxExecDuration=max(MaxExecDurationMs) by QueryId, PlanId, QueryType, UserId, DatabaseId
| top 10 by AvgMeanExecDuration desc
```



### Query counts  


Identify the execution counts trend of all queries.  

```query
// By default, entries are aggregated in QueryStore every 15 mins (see pg_qs.interval_length_minutes)
// AgregationWindow was set to 15min, but you may modify it based on your needs, however should not be less than pg_qs.interval_length_minutes. 
let AgregationWindow=15m;
PGSQLQueryStoreRuntime
| where IsSystemQuery==false //excludes azure managed user
| summarize sum(Calls) by bin(EndTime,AgregationWindow)
| render columnchart
```
