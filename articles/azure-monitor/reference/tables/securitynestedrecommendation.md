# SecurityNestedRecommendation

Nested recommendations can be thought of as 'sub' recommendations grouped into a 'parent' recommendation. To view nested recommendations, open the 'parent' from the recommendations page in Security Center. For example, if a vulnerability scan of your SQL databases returns 100 findings, each finding will be available as a nested recommendation within the parent recommendation 'Vulnerabilities on your SQL databases should be remediated'.
