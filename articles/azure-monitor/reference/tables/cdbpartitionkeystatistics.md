# CDBPartitionKeyStatistics

This table provides outlier logical partition keys that have consumed more storage space than others. Statistics are based on a sub-sampling of partition keys within the collection and hence these are approximate. Partition keys that are below 1GB of storage may not show up in the reported statistics.
