# OLPSupplyChainEvents

The events table captures every event that was dispatched from the Open Logistics Platform workspace. Events can be a result of a data plane API call (e.g. Shipment Created, Item Deleted, Notification sent, etc.) or a long running job operation completion (e.g. Data ingestion results in NewDataAvailable event).
