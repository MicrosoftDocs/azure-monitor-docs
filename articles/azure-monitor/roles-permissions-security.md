# Roles, permissions, and security in Azure Monitor

This article shows how to apply [role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) monitoring roles to grant or limit access, and discusses security considerations for your Azure Monitor-related resources.

## Built-in monitoring roles

[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) provides built-in roles for monitoring that you can assign to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. The most common roles are [*Monitoring Reader*](#monitoring-reader) and [*Monitoring Contributor*](#monitoring-contributor) for read and write permissions, respectively.

For more detailed information on the monitoring roles, see [RBAC Monitoring Roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#monitor).

### Monitoring Reader

People assigned the Monitoring Reader role can view all monitoring data in a subscription but can't modify any resource or edit any settings related to monitoring resources. This role is appropriate for users in an organization, such as support or operations engineers, who need to:

* View monitoring dashboards in the Azure portal.
* View alert rules defined in [Azure alerts](alerts/alerts-overview.md).
* Query Azure Monitor Metrics by using the [Azure Monitor REST API](/rest/api/monitor/metrics), [PowerShell cmdlets](powershell-samples.md), or [cross-platform CLI](cli-samples.md).
* Query the Activity log by using the portal, Azure Monitor REST API, PowerShell cmdlets, or cross-platform CLI.
* View the [diagnostic settings](essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) for a resource.
* View the [log profile](essentials/activity-log.md#legacy-collection-methods) for a subscription.
* View autoscale settings.
* View alert activity and settings.
* Search Log Analytics workspace data, including usage data for the workspace.
* Retrieve the table schemas in a Log Analytics workspace.
* Retrieve and execute log queries in a Log Analytics workspace.
* Access Application Insights data. 

> [!NOTE]
> This role doesn't give read access to log data that has been streamed to an event hub or stored in a storage account. For information on how to configure access to these resources, see the [Security considerations for monitoring data](#security-considerations-for-monitoring-data) section later in this article.

### Monitoring Contributor

People assigned the Monitoring Contributor role can view all monitoring data in a subscription. They can also create or modify monitoring settings, but they can't modify any other resources.

This role is a superset of the Monitoring Reader role. It's appropriate for members of an organization's monitoring team or managed service providers who, in addition to the permissions mentioned earlier, need to:

* View monitoring dashboards in the portal and create their own private monitoring dashboards.
* Create and edit [diagnostic settings](essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) for a resource. <sup>1</sup>
* Set alert rule activity and settings using [Azure alerts](alerts/alerts-overview.md).
* List shared keys for a Log Analytics workspace.
* Create, delete, and execute saved searches in a Log Analytics workspace.
* Create and delete the workspace storage configuration for Log Analytics.
* Create web tests and components for Application Insights.

<sup>1</sup> To create or edit a diagnostic setting, users must also separately be granted ListKeys permission on the target resource (storage account or event hub namespace).

> [!NOTE]
> This role doesn't give read access to log data that has been streamed to an event hub or stored in a storage account. For information on how to configure access to these resources, see the [Security considerations for monitoring data](#security-considerations-for-monitoring-data) section later in this article.

## Monitor permissions and Azure custom roles

If the built-in roles don't meet the needs of your team, you can [create an Azure custom role](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with [granular permissions](/azure/role-based-access-control/permissions/monitor).

For example, you can use granular permissions to create an Azure custom role for an Activity Log Reader with the following PowerShell script.

```powershell
$role = Get-AzRoleDefinition "Reader"
$role.Id = $null
$role.Name = "Activity Log Reader"
$role.Description = "Can view activity logs."
$role.Actions.Clear()
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Insights/eventtypes/*")
$role.AssignableScopes.Clear()
$role.AssignableScopes.Add("/subscriptions/mySubscription")
New-AzRoleDefinition -Role $role 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Access to alerts, diagnostic settings, and metrics for a resource requires that the user has read access to the resource type and scope of that resource. Creating a diagnostic setting that sends data to a storage account or streams to event hubs requires the user to also have ListKeys permission on the target resource.

## Assign a role

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

To assign a role, see [Assign Azure roles using Azure PowerShell](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell).

For example, the following PowerShell script assigns a role to a specified user.

Replace `<RoleId>` with the [RBAC Monitoring Role](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#monitor) ID you want to assign.

Replace `<SubscriptionID>`, `<ResourceGroupName>`, and `<UserPrincipalName>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

```powershell
# Define variables
$SubscriptionId = "<SubscriptionID>"
$ResourceGroupName = "<ResourceGroupName>"
$UserPrincipalName = "<UserPrincipalName>"  # The UPN of the user to whom you want to assign the role
$RoleId = "<RoleId>"  # The ID of the role

# Get the user object
$User = Get-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName $UserPrincipalName

# Define the scope (e.g., subscription or resource group level)
$Scope = "/subscriptions/$SubscriptionId/resourceGroups/$ResourceGroupName"

# Assign the role
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $User.Id -RoleDefinitionId $RoleId -Scope $Scope
```

You can also [Assign Azure roles by using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to assign roles in the specified scope. You must have *Owner* rights to the subscription or the resource group.
> - Assign access in the resource group or subscription to which your resource belongs, not in the resource itself.

## PowerShell query to determine role membership

It can be helpful to generate lists of users who belong to a given role. To help with generating these types of lists, the following sample queries can be adjusted to fit your specific needs.

### Query entire subscription for Admin roles + Contributor roles

```powershell
(Get-AzRoleAssignment -IncludeClassicAdministrators | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -in @('ServiceAdministrator', 'CoAdministrator', 'Owner', 'Contributor') } | Select -ExpandProperty SignInName | Sort-Object -Unique) -Join ", "
```

### Query within the context of a specific Application Insights resource for owners and contributors

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "ResourceGroupName"
$resourceName = "AppInsightsName"
$resourceType = "microsoft.insights/components"
(Get-AzRoleAssignment -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -ResourceType $resourceType -ResourceName $resourceName | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -in @('Owner', 'Contributor') } | Select -ExpandProperty SignInName | Sort-Object -Unique) -Join ", "
```

### Query within the context of a specific resource group for owners and contributors

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "ResourceGroupName"
(Get-AzRoleAssignment -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -in @('Owner', 'Contributor') } | Select -ExpandProperty SignInName | Sort-Object -Unique) -Join ", "
```

## Security considerations for monitoring data

[Data in Azure Monitor](data-platform.md) can be sent in a storage account or streamed to an event hub, both of which are general-purpose Azure resources. Being general-purpose resources, creating, deleting, and accessing them is a privileged operation reserved for an administrator. Since this data can contain sensitive information such as IP addresses or user names, use the following practices for monitoring-related resources to prevent misuse:

* Use a single, dedicated storage account for monitoring data. If you need to separate monitoring data into multiple storage accounts, the storage accounts should be used only for monitoring data. If you share storage accounts for monitoring and other types of data, you might inadvertently grant access to other data to organizations that should only access monitoring data. For example, a non-Microsoft organization for security information and event management should need only access to monitoring data.
* Use a single, dedicated service bus or event hub namespace across all diagnostic settings for the same reason described in the previous point.
* Limit access to monitoring-related storage accounts or event hubs by keeping them in a separate resource group. [Use scope](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview#scope) on your monitoring roles to limit access to only that resource group.
* You should never grant the ListKeys permission for either storage accounts or event hubs at subscription scope when a user only needs access to monitoring data. Instead, give these permissions to the user at a resource or resource group scope (if you have a dedicated monitoring resource group).

### Limit access to monitoring-related storage accounts

When a user or application needs access to monitoring data in a storage account, [generate a shared access signature (SAS)](/rest/api/storageservices/create-account-sas) on the storage account that contains monitoring data with service-level read-only access to blob storage. In PowerShell, the account SAS might look like the following code:

```powershell
$context = New-AzStorageContext -ConnectionString "[connection string for your monitoring Storage Account]"
$token = New-AzStorageAccountSASToken -ResourceType Service -Service Blob -Permission "rl" -Context $context
```

You can then give the token to the entity that needs to read from that storage account. The entity can list and read from all blobs in that storage account.

Alternatively, if you need to control this permission with Azure RBAC, you can grant that entity the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action` permission on that particular storage account. This permission is necessary for users who need to set a diagnostic setting to send data to a storage account. For example, you can create the following Azure custom role for a user or application that needs to read from only one storage account:

```powershell
$role = Get-AzRoleDefinition "Reader"
$role.Id = $null
$role.Name = "Monitoring Storage Account Reader"
$role.Description = "Can get the storage account keys for a monitoring storage account."
$role.Actions.Clear()
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action")
$role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/Read")
$role.AssignableScopes.Clear()
$role.AssignableScopes.Add("/subscriptions/mySubscription/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myMonitoringStorageAccount")
New-AzRoleDefinition -Role $role 
```

> [!WARNING]
> The ListKeys permission enables the user to list the primary and secondary storage account keys. These keys grant the user all signed permissions (such as read, write, create blobs, and delete blobs) across all signed services (blob, queue, table, file) in that storage account. We recommend using an account SAS when possible.

### Limit access to monitoring-related event hubs

You can follow a similar pattern with event hubs, but first you need to create a dedicated authorization rule for listening. If you want to grant access to an application that only needs to listen to monitoring-related event hubs, follow these steps:

1. In the portal, create a shared access policy on the event hubs that were created for streaming monitoring data with only listening claims. For example, you might call it "monitoringReadOnly." If possible, give that key directly to the consumer and skip the next step.
1. If the consumer needs to get the key on demand, grant the user the ListKeys action for that event hub. This step is also necessary for users who need to set a diagnostic setting or a log profile to stream to event hubs. For example, you might create an Azure RBAC rule:
   
   ```powershell
   $role = Get-AzRoleDefinition "Reader"
   $role.Id = $null
   $role.Name = "Monitoring Event Hub Listener"
   $role.Description = "Can get the key to listen to an event hub streaming monitoring data."
   $role.Actions.Clear()
   $role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/authorizationrules/listkeys/action")
   $role.Actions.Add("Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/Read")
   $role.AssignableScopes.Clear()
   $role.AssignableScopes.Add("/subscriptions/mySubscription/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/mySBNameSpace")
   New-AzRoleDefinition -Role $role 
   ```
