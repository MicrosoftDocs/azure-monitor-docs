sections:
  - name: Migration issues
    questions:
      - question: How long will SCOM Managed Instance be supported?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance will be fully deprecated by 30 September 2026. To avoid risks and interruptions, we recommend you to plan and complete the migration before support ends.
      - question: Can I run both SCOM Managed Instance and my new platform in parallel?
        answer: |
          Yes. During migration, it is common to operate both environments concurrently to ensure a smooth cutover but minimize this period to reduce complexity and cost.
      - question: Are there tools to automate migration?
        answer: |
          Microsoft and third-party vendors may offer scripts and migration aids to help export/import management packs, reconfigure agents, or automate parts of the process. Evaluate available resources relevant to your specific scenario.
      - question: How to get help
        answer: |
          - If you have questions, get answers from community experts in [Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/answers/).
          - If your organization or company has partnered with Microsoft or works with Microsoft representatives such as cloud solution architects (CSAs) or customer success account managers (CSAMs), contact them for additional resources for migration.
          - If you have a support plan and you need technical help, create a support request in the Azure portal.
