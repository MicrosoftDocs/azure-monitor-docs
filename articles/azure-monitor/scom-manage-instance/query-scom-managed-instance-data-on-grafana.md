# Query Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance data from Azure Managed Grafana dashboards

[!INCLUDE [retirement-banner.md](includes/retirement-banner.md)]

This article describes how to query monitoring data from Operational database and create dashboards on Azure Managed Grafana.

From Azure Managed Grafana linked to Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance, you can use SQL queries to get the monitored data from Operational database stored on Azure Managed SQL Managed Instance.

## Prerequisites

Before you query monitoring data from Azure Managed Grafana portal, ensure that SCOM Managed Instance is linked to Azure Managed Grafana. For more information, see [Dashboards on Azure Managed Grafana](./dashboards-on-azure-managed-grafana.md). 

Few ready-to-use dashboards are available at [Azure/SCOM Managed Instance/Operational Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19919-azure-scom-managed-instance-operational-dashboard/), which can be imported and edited as per your requirement on Azure Managed Grafana instance.

## Create a dashboard on Azure Managed Grafana

To create a dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Grafana and select **Add visualization**. You can choose the type of visualization based on the available options.
   :::image type="Add visualization" source="media/query-scom-managed-instance-data-on-grafana/add-visualization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add visualization.":::
1. Under **Panel options**, enter **Title** and **Description**.
   :::image type="panel options" source="media/query-scom-managed-instance-data-on-grafana/panel-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of panel options.":::
1. Under **Query**, select **Code** and enter the query.
   :::image type="code option" source="media/query-scom-managed-instance-data-on-grafana/code.png" alt-text="Screenshot of code options.":::
1. Select **Run query**.

## Sample queries

Following are few helpful sample queries and dashboards to get started on using Azure Managed Grafana with SCOM Managed Instance:

- Health state of workload  
- Workload health and the number of new alerts on them  
- Top events on workload
- Top alerts from workload  
- Performance data query for workload counter

The following queries help you to build Health, Alerts, and Top events from a particular workload/monitoring object:

>[!NOTE]
>- Replace the \<Management pack name prefix\> with the actual management pack name, say **Microsoft.SQL%** for SQL workload.
>- Replace the \<Monitoring Object Type\> with component class, say, **%.DBEngine** for SQL server role.

### Health state of workload  

```
SELECT HealthState =  

        CASE  

            WHEN MEV.HealthState = 1 THEN 'Healthy'  

            WHEN MEV.HealthState = 2 THEN 'Warning'  

            WHEN MEV.HealthState = 3 THEN 'Critical'  

            ELSE 'Uninitialized'  

        END,  

        CAST(COUNT(*)  AS DECIMAL(5, 2)) AS servers  

  FROM ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedEntityGenericView] MEV  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedTypeView] MTV ON MTV.Id = MEV.MonitoringClassId and MTV.name like '%.<Monitoring Object Type>'  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagementPackView] MPV ON MPV.Id = MTV.ManagementPackId and MPV.name like '<MP name Prefix>'  

  GROUP BY MEV.HealthState  

  ORDER BY MEV.HealthState  
```

### Workload health and the number of new alerts on them  

```
SELECT MEV.Name  

         ,HealthState =   

      CASE   

        WHEN MEV.HealthState = 1 THEN 'Healthy'  

        WHEN MEV.HealthState = 2 THEN 'Warning'  

        WHEN MEV.HealthState = 3 THEN 'Critical'  

        ELSE 'Uninitialized'  

      END  

      ,NewAlerts = COUNT(AV.ResolutionState)  

  FROM ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedEntityGenericView] MEV  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedTypeView] MTV ON MTV.Id = MEV.MonitoringClassId and MTV.name like '%.<Monitoring Object Type>'  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagementPackView] MPV ON MPV.Id = MTV.ManagementPackId and MPV.name like '%<MP name prefix>%'  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[AlertView] AV ON AV.MonitoringClassId = MTV.Id and AV.ResolutionState = 0 AND  $__timeFilter(TimeRaised)  

  GROUP BY MEV.Name, HealthState, AV.ResolutionState  
```

### Top events on workload

```
SELECT EventDescription = LT5.LTValue  

      ,Count(*) Occurences  

      ,AffectedSQLServers = Count(DISTINCT(EV.LoggingComputer))  

  FROM ${Database}.[dbo].[EventView] EV  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedTypeView] MTV ON MTV.Id = EV.ClassId   

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagementPackView] MPV ON MPV.Id = MTV.ManagementPackId and MPV.name like '%<MP Name Prefix>%'  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.dbo.LocalizedText LT5 ON EV.EventNumberStringId = LT5.LTStringId AND LT5.LanguageCode = 'ENU'  

  WHERE $__timeFilter(TimeGenerated) AND LevelId < 3  

GROUP BY Number, LT5.LTValue  

ORDER BY Occurences, AffectedSQLServers DESC;  
```

### Top alerts from workload  

```
SELECT AV.AlertStringName AS Alert  

      ,Occurrence = COUNT(AV.ResolutionState)  

      ,AffectedServers = COUNT(MEV.name)  

  FROM ${Database}.[dbo].[AlertView] AV  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedTypeView] MTV ON MTV.Id = AV.MonitoringClassId and MTV.name like '%<Monitoring Object Type>'  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagementPackView] MPV ON MPV.Id = MTV.ManagementPackId and MPV.name like '%M<MP Name Prefix>%'  

  INNER JOIN ${Database}.[dbo].[ManagedEntityGenericView] MEV ON MTV.Id = MEV.MonitoringClassId  

  where AV.ResolutionState = 0 and  $__timeFilter(TimeRaised)  

  GROUP BY AV.AlertStringName, AV.ResolutionState 
```

### Performance data query for workload counter

```
SELECT PD.TimeSampled 

   ,CASE  

		WHEN BME.Path IS NOT NULL AND BME.Path <> '' THEN CONCAT(BME.Path, '\', COALESCE(BME.Name, '')) 

		ELSE COALESCE(BME.Name, '') END AS TagetObjectPath 

  ,ObjectName = PC.ObjectName 

  ,CounterName = PC.CounterName 

  ,Value = PD.SampleValue 

  FROM dbo.PerformanceDataAllView PD  

  INNER JOIN dbo.PerformanceSource PS ON PD.PerformanceSourceInternalId = PS.PerformanceSourceInternalId 

  INNER JOIN dbo.PerformanceCounter PC ON PS.PerformanceCounterId = PC.PerformanceCounterId and CounterName = 'Receive I/Os/sec' 

  INNER JOIN dbo.BaseManagedEntity BME ON PS.BaseManagedEntityId = BME.BaseManagedEntityId AND BME.IsDeleted = 0  

  INNER JOIN [dbo].[ManagedTypeView] MTV ON MTV.Id = BME.BaseManagedTypeId  

  INNER JOIN [dbo].[ManagementPackView] MPV ON MPV.Id = MTV.ManagementPackId and MPV.name like 'Microsoft.SQL%' 
```
