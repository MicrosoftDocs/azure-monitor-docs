# Monitor Linux machines

Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance provides a cloud-based alternative for Operations Manager users providing monitoring continuity for cloud and on-premises environments across the cloud adoption journey.

>[!NOTE]
>- Linux monitoring is supported only via Managed Gateways.
>- Azure and Arc-enabled Linux machines aren't supported.

With SCOM Managed Instance, you can monitor Linux workloads that are on-premises and behind a gateway server. At this stage, we don't support monitoring Linux VMs hosted in Azure. For more information, see [How to monitor on-premises Linux VMs](/system-center/scom/manage-deploy-crossplat-agent-console).
