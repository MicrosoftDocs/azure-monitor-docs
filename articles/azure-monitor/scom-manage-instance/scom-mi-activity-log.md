# Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance activity log 

The Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance activity log is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. The activity log includes information such as when a SCOM Managed Instance resource is created or modified or patched with new software and scaled or deleted. This article provides information on how to view the activity log.

>[!Note]
>- Entries in the Activity Log are system generated and can't be changed or deleted. 
>- Entries in the Activity Log represent control plane changes such as create, update, scale, patch, or delete SCOM Managed Instance.

## Retention period 

Activity log events are retained in Azure for 90 days and then deleted. There's no charge for entries during this time regardless of volume. For more functionality, such as longer retention, create a diagnostic setting and route the entries to another location based on your needs.  

## View the activity log 

You can access the activity log from the Azure portal. The menu that you open it from determines its initial filter. You can change the filter to view all other entries. Select **Add Filter**  to add more properties to the filter. 

For more information on activity log categories, see [Azure activity log event schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema#categories).

## Download the activity log 

Select **Download as CSV** to download the events in the current view.
