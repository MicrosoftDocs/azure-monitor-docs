# Create an Azure key vault

This article describes how to create a key vault to store domain credentials.

>[!NOTE]
> To learn about the Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance architecture, see [Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance](overview.md).

## Create a key vault to store secrets

For security, you can store domain account credentials in key vault secrets. Later, you can use these secrets in SCOM Managed Instance creation.

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for keys, secrets, and certificates. For more information, see [About Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview).

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Key vaults**.
