# Create a separate subnet in a virtual network for Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance

[!INCLUDE [retirement-banner.md](includes/retirement-banner.md)]

This article describes how to create a separate subnet in a virtual network for a managed instance of Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance and enable Azure NAT Gateway on a SCOM Managed Instance subnet.

>[!NOTE]
> To learn about the SCOM Managed Instance architecture, see [Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance](overview.md#architecture).

## Create a separate subnet in a virtual network

For more information on how to create a virtual network, see [Quickstart: Use the Azure portal to create a virtual network](/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal).

After a SCOM Managed Instance subnet is created, we need a NAT gateway for outbound internet access from the SCOM Managed Instance subnet. Edit the subnet to add a NAT gateway. In Azure, add a NAT gateway to the subnet where the SCOM managed instance is created. A NAT gateway is needed for outbound internet access from the SCOM Managed Instance subnet. For more information, see [What is Virtual Network NAT?](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview).

>[!NOTE]
>The SCOM Managed Instance requires outbound Internet access for communication with dependent endpoints. We recommend to use a NAT Gateway for this purpose. However, if there is an already established outbound internet access through a firewall, you can skip the creation of a NAT Gateway.

To create a NAT gateway for a SCOM Managed Instance subnet, follow these steps:

1. Create a NAT gateway in the same region where the virtual network is present.
1. Create a NAT gateway in the same subscription that you use for SCOM Managed Instance.
1. Create a public IP.

1. In the subnet section, select a virtual network and subnet for SCOM Managed Instance.
