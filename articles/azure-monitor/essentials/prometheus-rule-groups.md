# Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus rule groups
Rules in Prometheus act on data as it's collected. They're configured as part of a Prometheus rule group, which is applied to Prometheus metrics in [Azure Monitor workspace](azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). 

## Rule types
There are two types of Prometheus rules as described in the following table.

| Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Alert |[Alert rules ](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio-alertrules)let you create an Azure Monitor alert based on the results of a Prometheus Query Language (Prom QL) query.  Alerts fired by Azure Managed Prometheus alert rules are processed and trigger notifications in similar way to other Azure Monitor alerts.|
| Recording |[Recording rules](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio-recrules) allow you to precompute frequently needed or computationally extensive expressions and store their result as a new set of time series. Time series created by recording rules are ingested back to your Azure Monitor workspace as new Prometheus metrics. |

## Create Prometheus rules
Azure Managed Prometheus rule groups, recording rules and alert rules can be created and configured using The Azure resource type **Microsoft.AlertsManagement/prometheusRuleGroups**, where the alert rules and recording rules are defined as part of the rule group properties. Prometheus rule groups are defined with a scope of a specific [Azure Monitor workspace](azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md).  Prometheus rule groups can be created using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, API, Azure CLI, or PowerShell. 

Azure managed Prometheus rule groups follow the structure and terminology of the open source Prometheus rule groups. Rule names, expression, 'for' clause, labels, annotations are all supported in the Azure version. The following key differences between OSS rule groups and Azure managed Prometheus should be noted:
* Azure managed Prometheus rule groups are managed as Azure resources, and include necessary information for resource management, such as the subscription and resource group where the Azure rule group should reside.
* Azure managed Prometheus alert rules include dedicated properties that allow alerts to be processed like other Azure Monitor alerts. For example, alert severity, action group association, and alert auto resolve configuration are supported as part of Azure managed Prometheus alert rules.

> [!NOTE]
> For your AKS or ARC Kubernetes clusters, you can use some of the recommended alerts rules. See pre-defined alert rules [here](../containers/container-insights-metric-alerts.md#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

### Limiting rules to a specific cluster

You can optionally limit the rules in a rule group to query data originating from a single specific cluster, by adding a cluster scope to your rule group, and/or by using the rule group `clusterName` property.
You should limit rules to a single cluster if your Azure Monitor workspace contains a large amount of data from multiple clusters. In such a case, there's a concern that running a single set of rules on all the data may cause performance or throttling issues. By using the cluster scope, you can create multiple rule groups, each configured with the same rules, with each group covering a different cluster. 

To limit your rule group to a cluster scope [using an ARM template](#creating-prometheus-rule-group-using-resource-manager-template), you should add the Azure Resource ID of your cluster to the rule group **scopes[]** list. **The scopes list must still include the Azure Monitor workspace resource ID**. The following cluster resource types are supported as a cluster scope:
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters (Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters)
* Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters (Microsoft.kubernetes/connectedClusters)
* Azure connected appliances (Microsoft.ResourceConnector/appliances)

In addition to the cluster ID, you can configure the **clusterName** property of your rule group. The 'clusterName' property must match the `cluster` label that is added to your metrics when scraped from a specific cluster. By default, this label is set to the last part (resource name) of your cluster ID. If you've changed this label using the ['cluster_alias'](../essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration.md#cluster-alias) setting in your cluster scraping configmap, you must include the updated value in the rule group 'clusterName' property. If your scraping uses the default 'cluster' label value, the 'clusterName' property is optional.

Here's an example of how a rule group is configured to limit query to a specific cluster:

``` json
{
    "name": "sampleRuleGroup",
    "type": "Microsoft.AlertsManagement/prometheusRuleGroups",
    "apiVersion": "2023-03-01",
    "location": "northcentralus",
    "properties": {
         "description": "Sample Prometheus Rule Group limited to a specific cluster",
         "scopes": [
             "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.monitor/accounts/<azure-monitor-workspace-name>",
             "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/<myClusterName>"
         ],
         "clusterName": "<myCLusterName>",
         "rules": [
             {
                ...
             }
         ]
    }
}        
```
If both cluster ID scope and `clusterName` aren't specified  for a rule group, the rules in the group query data from all the clusters in the workspace from all clusters.

You can also limit your rule group to a cluster scope using the [portal UI](#configure-the-rule-group-scope).

### Creating Prometheus rule group using Resource Manager template

You can use a Resource Manager template to create and configure Prometheus rule groups, alert rules, and recording rules. Resource Manager templates enable you to programmatically create and configure rule groups in a consistent and reproducible way across all your environments.

The basic steps are as follows:

1. Use the following template as a JSON file that describes how to create the rule group.
2. Deploy the template using any deployment method, such as [Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal), [Azure CLI](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell), or [Rest API](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-rest).

### Template example for a Prometheus rule group
Following is a sample template that creates a Prometheus rule group, including one recording rule and one alert rule. This template creates a resource of type `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/prometheusRuleGroups`. The scope of this group is limited to a single AKS cluster. The rules are executed in the order they appear within a group.

                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}        
```

The following tables describe each of the properties in the rule definition.

### Converting Prometheus rules file to a Prometheus rule group ARM template

If you have a [Prometheus rules configuration file](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#configuring-rules) (in YAML format), you can now convert it to an Azure Prometheus rule group ARM template, using the [az-prom-rules-converter utility](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/tree/main/tools/az-prom-rules-converter#az-prom-rules-converter). The rules file can contain definition of one or more rule groups.

In addition to the rules file, you must provide the utility with other properties that are needed to create the Azure Prometheus rule groups, including: subscription, resource group, location, target Azure Monitor workspace, target cluster ID and name, and action groups (used for alert rules). The utility creates a template file that can be deployed directly or within a deployment pipe providing some of these properties as parameters. Properties that you provide to the utility are used for all the rule groups in the template. For example, all rule groups in the file are created in the same subscription, resource group and location, and using the same Azure Monitor workspace. If an action group is provided as a parameter to the utility, the same action group is used in all the alert rules in the template. If you want to change this default configuration (for example, use different action groups in different rules) you can edit the resulting template according to your needs, before deploying it.

> [!NOTE] 
> The az-prom-convert-utility is provided as a courtesy tool. We recommend that you review the resulting template and verify it matches your intended configuration.

### Creating Prometheus rule group using Azure CLI

You can use Azure CLI to create and configure Prometheus rule groups, alert rules, and recording rules. The following code examples use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). 

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Cloud Shell**. At the prompt, use the commands that follow.

2. To create a Prometheus rule group, use the `az alerts-management prometheus-rule-group create` command. You can see detailed documentation on the Prometheus rule group create command in the `az alerts-management prometheus-rule-group create` section of the [Azure CLI commands for creating and managing Prometheus rule groups](/cli/azure/alerts-management/prometheus-rule-group#commands).

Example: Create a new Prometheus rule group with rules

```azurecli
 az alerts-management prometheus-rule-group create -n TestPrometheusRuleGroup -g TestResourceGroup -l westus --enabled --description "test" --interval PT10M --scopes "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/testrg/providers/microsoft.monitor/accounts/testaccount" --rules [{"record":"test","expression":"test","labels":{"team":"prod"}},{"alert":"Billing_Processing_Very_Slow","expression":"test","enabled":"true","severity":2,"for":"PT5M","labels":{"team":"prod"},"annotations":{"annotationName1":"annotationValue1"},"resolveConfiguration":{"autoResolved":"true","timeToResolve":"PT10M"},"actions":[{"actionGroupId":"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testrg/providers/microsoft.insights/actionGroups/test-action-group-name1","actionProperties":{"key11":"value11","key12":"value12"}},{"actionGroupId":"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testrg/providers/microsoft.insights/actionGroups/test-action-group-name2","actionProperties":{"key21":"value21","key22":"value22"}}]}]
```

### Create a new Prometheus rule group with PowerShell

To create a Prometheus rule group using PowerShell, use the [new-azprometheusrulegroup](/powershell/module/az.alertsmanagement/new-azprometheusrulegroup) cmdlet.

Example: Create Prometheus rule group definition with rules.

```powershell
$rule1 = New-AzPrometheusRuleObject -Record "job_type:billing_jobs_duration_seconds:99p5m"
$action =  New-AzPrometheusRuleGroupActionObject -ActionGroupId /subscriptions/fffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff/resourceGroups/MyresourceGroup/providers/microsoft.insights/actiongroups/MyActionGroup -ActionProperty @{"key1" = "value1"}
$Timespan = New-TimeSpan -Minutes 15
$rule2 = New-AzPrometheusRuleObject -Alert Billing_Processing_Very_Slow -Expression "job_type:billing_jobs_duration_seconds:99p5m > 30" -Enabled $false -Severity 3 -For $Timespan -Label @{"team"="prod"} -Annotation @{"annotation" = "value"} -ResolveConfigurationAutoResolved $true -ResolveConfigurationTimeToResolve $Timespan -Action $action
$rules = @($rule1, $rule2)
$scope = "/subscriptions/fffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff/resourcegroups/MyresourceGroup/providers/microsoft.monitor/accounts/MyAccounts"
New-AzPrometheusRuleGroup -ResourceGroupName MyresourceGroup -RuleGroupName MyRuleGroup -Location eastus -Rule $rules -Scope $scope -Enabled
```
## View Prometheus rule groups
You can view your Prometheus rule groups and their included rules in the Azure portal in one of the following ways:
* In the [portal home page](https://portal.azure.com/), in the search box, look for **Prometheus Rule Groups**.
* In the [portal home page](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Monitor** > **Alerts**, then select **Prometheus Rule Groups**.
      :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-metrics-rule-groups/prometheus-rule-groups-from-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to view Prometheus rule groups from the alerts screen.":::
* In the page of a specific Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) resource, or a specific Azure Monitor Workspace (AMW), select **Monitor** > **Alerts**, then select **Prometheus Rule Groups**, to view a list of rule groups for this specific resource.
You can select a rule group from the list to view or edit its details.

## View the resource health states of your Prometheus rule groups
You can now view the [resource health state](../../service-health/resource-health-overview.md) of your Prometheus rule group in the portal. This can allow you to detect problems in your rule groups, such as incorrect configuration, or query throttling problems

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the overview of your Prometheus rule group you would like to monitors
1. From the left pane, under **Help**, select **Resource health**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-metrics-rule-groups/prometheus-rule-groups-resource-health.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to view resource health state of a Prometheus rule group.":::
1. In the rule group resource health screen, you can see the current availability state of the rule group, as well as a history of recent resource health events, up to 30 days back.
    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-metrics-rule-groups/prometheus-rule-groups-resource-health-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to view the resource health history of a Prometheus rule group.":::

* If the rule group is marked as **Available**, it is working as expected.
* If the rule group is marked as **Degraded**, one or more rules in the group are not working as expected. This can be due to the rule query being throttled, or to other issues that may cause the rule evaluation to fail. Expand the status entry for more information on the detected problem, as well as suggestions for mitigation or for further troubleshooting.
* If the rule group is marked as **Unavailable**, the entire rule group is not working as expected. This can be due the configuration issue (for example, the Azure Monitor Workspace can't be detected) or due to internal service issues. Expand the status entry for more information on the detected problem, as well as suggestions for mitigation or for further troubleshooting.
* If the rule group is marked as **Unknown**, the entire rule group is disabled or is in an unknown state.
     
## Disable and enable rule groups 
To enable or disable a rule, select the rule group in the Azure portal. Select either **Enable** or **Disable** to change its status.
