# Configure self-managed Grafana to use Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus with Microsoft Entra ID.

[Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](prometheus-metrics-overview.md) allows you to collect and analyze metrics at scale using a [Prometheus](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio)-compatible monitoring solution. The most common way to analyze and present Prometheus data is with a Grafana dashboard. This article explains how to configure Prometheus as a data source for [self-hosted Grafana](https://grafana.com/) using Microsoft Entra ID. 
 
For information on using Grafana with managed system identity, see [Configure Grafana using managed system identity](./prometheus-grafana.md).

## Microsoft Entra authentication

To set up Microsoft Entra authentication, follow the steps below:
1. Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Grant access for the app to your Azure Monitor workspace.
1. Configure your self-hosted Grafana with the app's credentials.
<a name='register-an-app-with-azure-active-directory'></a>

## Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID

1. To register an app, open the Active Directory Overview page in the Azure portal.

1. Select **New registration**.
1. On the Register an application page, enter a **Name** for the application.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory(Tenant) ID**. They're used in the Grafana authentication settings.

1. On the app's overview page, select **Certificates and Secrets**.
1. In the client secrets tab, select **New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description**.
1. Select an **expiry** period from the dropdown and select **Add**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Create a process to renew the secret and update your Grafana data source settings before the secret expires. 
    > Once the secret expires Grafana will lose the ability to query data from your Azure Monitor workspace.

1. Copy and save the client secret **Value**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Client secret values can only be viewed immediately after creation. Be sure to save the secret before leaving the page.

### Allow your app access to your workspace

Allow your app to query data from your Azure Monitor workspace.  

1. Open your Azure Monitor workspace in the Azure portal. 

1. On the Overview page, take note of your **Query endpoint**. The query endpoint is used when setting up your Grafana data source. 
1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add**, then **Add role assignment** from the **Access Control (IAM)** page.  

1. On the **Add role Assignment** page, search for **Monitoring**.
1. Select **Monitoring data reader**, then select the **Members** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/prometheus-self-managed-grafana-azure-active-directory/add-role-assignment.png"  lightbox="./media/prometheus-self-managed-grafana-azure-active-directory/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Add role assignment page.":::

1. Select **Select members**.
1. Search for the app that you registered in the [Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID](#register-an-app-with-azure-active-directory) section and select it.
1. Click **Select**.
1. Select **Review + assign**.

You've created your App registration and have assigned it access to query data from your Azure Monitor workspace. The next step is setting up your Prometheus data source in Grafana. 


## Setup self-managed Grafana to turn on Azure Authentication.  

Grafana now supports connecting to Azure Monitor managed Prometheus using the [Prometheus data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/). For self-hosted Grafana instances, a configuration change is needed to use the Azure Authentication option in Grafana. For self-hosted Grafana or any other Grafana instances that are not managed by Azure, make the following changes:

1. Locate the Grafana configuration file. See the [Configure Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v9.0/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/) documentation for details. 
1. Identify your Grafana version.
1. Update the Grafana configuration file.

    For Grafana 9.0: 

    ```     
        [feature_toggles] 
        # Azure authentication for Prometheus (<=9.0) 
        prometheus_azure_auth = true 
    ```
 

    For Grafana 9.1 and later versions: 

    ```
        [auth] 
        # Azure authentication for Prometheus (>=9.1) 
        azure_auth_enabled = true 
    ```

 For Azure Managed Grafana, you don't need to make any configuration changes. Managed Identity is also enabled by default.

## Configure your Prometheus data source in Grafana

1. Sign-in to your Grafana instance.

1. On the configuration page, select the **Data sources** tab.
1. Select **Add data source**.
1. Select **Prometheus**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your Prometheus data source.
1. In the **URL** field, paste the Query endpoint value from the Azure Monitor workspace overview page.
1. Under **Auth**, turn on  **Azure Authentication**.
1. In the Azure Authentication section, select **App Registration** from the **Authentication** dropdown.
1. Enter the **Direct(tenant) ID**, **Application (client) ID**, and the **Client secret** from the [Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID](#register-an-app-with-azure-active-directory) section.
1. Select **Save & test**
