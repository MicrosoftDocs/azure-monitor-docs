# Sample transformations in Azure Monitor


## Send data to single destination

The following example is a DCR for Azure Monitor Agent that sends data to the `Syslog` table. In this example, the transformation filters the data for records with `error` in the message.

```json
{ 
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources" : [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules", 
            "name": "singleDestinationDCR", 
            "apiVersion": "2021-09-01-preview", 
            "location": "eastus", 
            "properties": { 
              "dataSources": { 
                "syslog": [ 
                  { 
                    "name": "sysLogsDataSource", 
                    "streams": [ 
                      "Microsoft-Syslog" 
                    ], 
                    "facilityNames": [ 
                      "auth",
                      "authpriv",
                      "cron",
                      "daemon",
                      "mark",
                      "kern",
                      "mail",
                      "news",
                      "syslog",
                      "user",
                      "uucp"
                    ], 
                    "logLevels": [ 
                      "Debug", 
                      "Critical", 
                      "Emergency" 
                    ] 
                  } 
                ] 
              }, 
              "destinations": { 
                "logAnalytics": [ 
                  { 
                    "workspaceResourceId": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/my-workspace", 
                    "name": "centralWorkspace" 
                  } 
                ] 
              }, 
              "dataFlows": [ 
                { 
                  "streams": [ 
                    "Microsoft-Syslog" 
                  ], 
                  "transformKql": "source | where message has 'error'", 
                  "destinations": [ 
                    "centralWorkspace" 
                  ] 
                } 
              ] 
            }
        }
    ]
} 
```

## Send data to multiple destinations

The following example is a DCR for data from the Logs Ingestion API that sends data to both the `Syslog` and `SecurityEvent` tables. This DCR requires a separate `dataFlow` for each with a different `transformKql` and `OutputStream` for each. In this example, all incoming data is sent to the `Syslog` table while malicious data is also sent to the `SecurityEvent` table. If you didn't want to replicate the malicious data in both tables, you could add a `where` statement to first query to remove those records.

```json
{ 
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources" : [
        { 
            "type": "Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules", 
            "name": "multiDestinationDCR", 
            "location": "eastus", 
            "apiVersion": "2021-09-01-preview", 
            "properties": { 
                "dataCollectionEndpointId": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers//Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints/my-dce",
                "streamDeclarations": { 
                    "Custom-MyTableRawData": { 
                        "columns": [ 
                            { 
                                "name": "Time", 
                                "type": "datetime" 
                            }, 
                            { 
                                "name": "Computer", 
                                "type": "string" 
                            }, 
                            { 
                                "name": "AdditionalContext", 
                                "type": "string" 
                            } 
                        ] 
                    } 
                }, 
                "destinations": { 
                    "logAnalytics": [ 
                        { 
                            "workspaceResourceId": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/my-workspace", 
                            "name": "clv2ws1" 
                        }, 
                    ] 
                }, 
                "dataFlows": [ 
                    { 
                        "streams": [ 
                            "Custom-MyTableRawData" 
                        ], 
                        "destinations": [ 
                            "clv2ws1" 
                        ], 
                        "transformKql": "source | project TimeGenerated = Time, Computer, Message = AdditionalContext", 
                        "outputStream": "Microsoft-Syslog" 
                    }, 
                    { 
                        "streams": [ 
                            "Custom-MyTableRawData" 
                        ], 
                        "destinations": [ 
                            "clv2ws1" 
                        ], 
                        "transformKql": "source | where (AdditionalContext has 'malicious traffic!' | project TimeGenerated = Time, Computer, Subject = AdditionalContext", 
                        "outputStream": "Microsoft-SecurityEvent" 
                    } 
                ] 
            } 
        }
    ]
}
```

## Combination of Azure and custom tables

The following example is a DCR for data from the Logs Ingestion API that sends data to both the `Syslog` table and a custom table with the data in a different format. This DCR requires a separate `dataFlow` for each with a different `transformKql` and `OutputStream` for each. When using custom tables, it is important to ensure that the schema of the destination (your custom table) contains the custom columns ([how-to add or delete custom columns](../logs/create-custom-table.md#add-or-delete-a-custom-column)) that match the schema of the records you are sending. For instance, if your record has a field called SyslogMessage, but the destination custom table only has TimeGenerated and RawData, you’ll receive an event in the custom table with only the TimeGenerated field populated and the RawData field will be empty. The SyslogMessage field will be dropped because the schema of the destination table doesn’t contain a string field called SyslogMessage.
