# Sample transformations in Azure Monitor


## Send data to single destination

The following example is a DCR for Azure Monitor Agent that sends data to the `Syslog` table. In this example, the transformation filters the data for records with `error` in the message.

```json
{ 
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources" : [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules", 
            "name": "singleDestinationDCR", 
            "apiVersion": "2021-09-01-preview", 
            "location": "eastus", 
            "properties": { 
              "dataSources": { 
                "syslog": [ 
                  { 
                    "name": "sysLogsDataSource", 
                    "streams": [ 
                      "Microsoft-Syslog" 
                    ], 
                    "facilityNames": [ 
                      "auth",
                      "authpriv",

                      "daemon",
                      "mark",

                      "uucp"
                    ], 
                    "logLevels": [ 
                      "Debug", 
                      "Critical", 
                      "Emergency" 
                    ] 
                  } 
                ] 
              }, 
              "destinations": { 
                "logAnalytics": [ 
                  { 
                    "workspaceResourceId": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/my-workspace", 
                    "name": "centralWorkspace" 
                  } 
                ] 
              }, 
              "dataFlows": [ 
                { 
                  "streams": [ 
                    "Microsoft-Syslog" 
                  ], 
                  "transformKql": "source | where message has 'error'", 
                  "destinations": [ 
                    "centralWorkspace" 
                  ] 
                } 
              ] 
            }
        }
    ]
} 
```

## Send data to multiple destinations

With transformations, you can send data to multiple destinations in a Log Analytics workspace by using a single DCR. You provide a KQL query for each destination, and the results of each query are sent to their corresponding location. You can send different sets of data to different tables or use multiple queries to send different sets of data to the same table. To use multiple destinations, you must currently either manually create a new DCR or [edit an existing one](data-collection-rule-edit.md). 

For example, you might send event data into Azure Monitor by using the Logs Ingestion API. Most of the events should be sent an analytics table where it could be queried regularly, while audit events should be sent to a custom table configured for [basic logs](../logs/logs-table-plans.md) to reduce your cost.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the tables in the DCR must be in the same Log Analytics workspace. To send to multiple workspaces from a single data source, use multiple DCRs and configure your application to send the data to each.

The following example is a DCR for data from the Logs Ingestion API that sends data to both the `Syslog` and `SecurityEvent` tables. This DCR requires a separate `dataFlow` for each with a different `transformKql` and `OutputStream` for each. In this example, all incoming data is sent to the `Syslog` table while malicious data is also sent to the `SecurityEvent` table. If you didn't want to replicate the malicious data in both tables, you could add a `where` statement to first query to remove those records.

                    } 
                ] 
            } 
        }
    ]
}
```

## Combination of Azure and custom tables

The following example is a DCR for data from the Logs Ingestion API that sends data to both the `Syslog` table and a custom table with the data in a different format. This DCR requires a separate `dataFlow` for each with a different `transformKql` and `OutputStream` for each. When using custom tables, it is important to ensure that the schema of the destination (your custom table) contains the custom columns ([how-to add or delete custom columns](../logs/create-custom-table.md#add-or-delete-a-custom-column)) that match the schema of the records you are sending. For instance, if your record has a field called SyslogMessage, but the destination custom table only has TimeGenerated and RawData, you’ll receive an event in the custom table with only the TimeGenerated field populated and the RawData field will be empty. The SyslogMessage field will be dropped because the schema of the destination table doesn’t contain a string field called SyslogMessage.

## Parse data
A common use of transformations is to parse incoming data into multiple columns to match the schema of the destination table. For example, you may collect entries from a log file that isn't in a structured format and need to parse the data into columns for the table.
