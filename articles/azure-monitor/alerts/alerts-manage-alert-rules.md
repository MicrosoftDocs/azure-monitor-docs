# Manage your alert rules

Manage your alert rules in the Azure portal, or using the CLI or PowerShell.

## Manage alert rules in the Azure portal

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Monitor**, then **Alerts**.
1. From the top command bar, select **Alert rules**. The page shows all your alert rules on all subscriptions.

    :::image type="content" source="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/alerts-rules-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the alerts rules page.":::

1. You can filter the list of rules using the available filters:
    - Subscription
    - Alert condition
    - Severity
    - User response
    - Monitor service
    - Signal type
    - Resource group
    - Target resource type
    - Resource name
    - Suppression status

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you filter on a `target resource type` scope, the alerts rules list doesn’t include resource health alert rules. To see the resource health alert rules, remove the `Target resource type` filter, or filter the rules based on the `Resource group` or `Subscription`.

1. Select an alert rule or use the checkboxes on the left to select multiple alert rules. 
1. If you select multiple alert rules, you can enable or disable the selected rules. Selecting multiple rules can be useful when you want to perform maintenance on specific resources. 
1. If you select a single alert rule, you can edit, disable, duplicate, or delete the rule in the alert rule pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/alerts-rules-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the alerts rules pane.":::

1. To edit an alert rule, select **Edit**, and then edit any of the fields in the following sections. You can't edit the **Alert Rule Name**, or the **Signal type** of an existing alert rule.
    - **Scope**. You can edit the scope for all alert rules **other than**:
        - Log search alert rules
        - Metric alert rules that monitor a custom metric
        - Metric alert rules based on Azure Monitor Logs
        - Smart detection alert rules
    - **Condition**. Learn more about conditions for [metric alert rules](./alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md?tabs=metric#tabpanel_1_metric), [log search alert rules](./alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md?tabs=log#tabpanel_1_log), and [activity log alert rules](./alerts-create-new-alert-rule.md?tabs=activity-log#tabpanel_1_activity-log)
    - **Actions**
    - **Alert rule details**
1. Select **Save** on the top command bar.

> [!NOTE]
> This section describes how to manage alert rules created in the latest UI or using an API version later than `2018-04-16`. See [View and manage log search alert rules created in previous versions](alerts-manage-alerts-previous-version.md) for information about how to view and manage log search alert rules created in the previous UI.

## Enable recommended alert rules in the Azure portal

You can [create a new alert rule](alerts-log.md#create-a-new-log-alert-rule-in-the-azure-portal), or enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules in the Azure portal.

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:
- The resource provider’s knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells us what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

> [!NOTE]
> The alert rule recommendations feature is enabled for:
> - Virtual machines
> - AKS resources
> - Log Analytics workspaces

:::image type="content" source="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/enable-recommended-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of alerts page with link to recommended alert rules.":::

To enable recommended alert rules:

1. In the left pane, select **Alerts**. 
1. Select **View + set up**. The **Set up recommended alert rules** pane opens with a list of recommended alert rules based on your type of resource.

    :::image type="content" source="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/set-up-recommended-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recommended alert rules pane.":::

1. In the **Select alert rules** section, all recommended alerts are populated with the default values for the rule condition, such as the percentage of CPU usage that you want to trigger an alert. You can change the default values if you would like, or turn off an alert.
1. Expand each of the alert rules to see its details. By default, the severity for each is **Informational**. You can change to another severity if you'd like.

    :::image type="content" source="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/configure-alert-severity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recommended alert rule severity configuration." lightbox="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/configure-alert-severity.png":::

1. In the **Notify me by** section, select the way you want to be notified if an alert is fired.
1. Select **Use an existing action group**, and enter the details of the existing action group if you want to use an action group that already exists.
1. Select **Save**.

## See the history of when an alert rule triggered

To see the history of an alert rule, you must have a role with read permissions on the subscription containing the resource on which the alert fired.

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Monitor**, then **Alerts**.
1. From the top command bar, select **Alert rules**. The page shows all your alert rules on all subscriptions.

    :::image type="content" source="media/alerts-managing-alert-instances/alerts-rules-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the alerts rules page.":::

1. Select an alert rule, and then select **History** on the left pane to see the history of when the alert rule triggered.

## Manage metric alert rules with the Azure CLI

This section describes how to manage metric alert rules using the cross-platform [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli). The following examples use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). 

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Cloud Shell**.
1. Use these options of the `az monitor metrics alert` CLI command in this table:

    
    |What you want to do|CLI command  |
    |---------|---------|
    |View all the metric alerts in a resource group|`az monitor metrics alert list -g {ResourceGroup}`|
    |See the details of a metric alert rule|`az monitor metrics alert show -g {ResourceGroup} -n {AlertRuleName}`|
    |     |`az monitor metrics alert show --ids {RuleResourceId}`|
    |Disable a metric alert rule|`az monitor metrics alert update -g {ResourceGroup} -n {AlertRuleName} --enabled false`|
    |Delete a metric alert rule|`az monitor metrics alert delete -g {ResourceGroup} -n {AlertRuleName}`|
    |Learn more about the command|`az monitor metrics alert --help`|

## Manage metric alert rules with PowerShell

Metric alert rules have these dedicated PowerShell cmdlets:

- [Add-AzMetricAlertRuleV2](/powershell/module/az.monitor/add-azmetricalertrulev2): Create a new metric alert rule or update an existing one.
- [Get-AzMetricAlertRuleV2](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetricalertrulev2): Get one or more metric alert rules.
- [Remove-AzMetricAlertRuleV2](/powershell/module/az.monitor/remove-azmetricalertrulev2): Delete a metric alert rule.

## Manage metric alert rules with REST API

- [Create Or Update](/rest/api/monitor/metricalerts/createorupdate): Create a new metric alert rule or update an existing one.

- [Delete](/rest/api/monitor/metricalerts/delete): Delete a metric alert rule.

## Delete metric alert rules defined on a deleted resource

When you delete an Azure resource, associated metric alert rules aren't deleted automatically. To delete alert rules associated with a resource that's been deleted:

1. Open the resource group in which the deleted resource was defined.
1. In the list that displays the resources, select the **Show hidden types** checkbox.
1. Filter the list by Type == **microsoft.insights/metricalerts**.
1. Select the relevant alert rules and select **Delete**.

To check the current number of metric alert rules in use, follow the next steps.
### From the Azure portal

   1. Open the **Alerts** screen and select **Manage alert rules**.
   1. Filter to the relevant subscription by using the **Subscription** dropdown box.
   1. Make sure *not* to filter to a specific resource group, resource type, or resource.
   1. In the **Signal type** dropdown box, select **Metrics**.
   1. Verify that the **Status** dropdown box is set to **Enabled**.
   1. The total number of metric alert rules are displayed above the alert rules list.
    
### Using the API

   - **PowerShell**: [Get-AzMetricAlertRuleV2](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetricalertrulev2)
   - **REST API**: [List by subscription](/rest/api/monitor/metricalerts/listbysubscription)

## Manage log search alert rules using the CLI

This section describes how to manage log search alerts using the cross-platform [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli). The following examples use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure CLI support is only available for the scheduledQueryRules API version `2021-08-01` and later. Previous API versions can use the Azure Resource Manager CLI with templates as described below. If you use the legacy [Log Analytics Alert API](./api-alerts.md), you will need to switch to use CLI. [Learn more about switching](./alerts-log-api-switch.md).

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Cloud Shell**.
1. Use these options of the `az monitor scheduled-query alert` CLI command in this table:
    
    |What you want to do|CLI command  |
    |---------|---------|
    |View all the log alert rules in a resource group|`az monitor scheduled-query list -g {ResourceGroup}`|
    |See the details of a log alert rule|`az monitor scheduled-query show -g {ResourceGroup} -n {AlertRuleName}`|
    |     |`az monitor scheduled-query show --ids {RuleResourceId}`|
    |Disable a log alert rule|`az monitor scheduled-query update -g {ResourceGroup} -n {AlertRuleName} --disabled true`|
    |Delete a log alert rule|`az monitor scheduled-query delete -g {ResourceGroup} -n {AlertRuleName}`|
    |Learn more about the command|`az monitor scheduled-query --help`|

### Manage log search alert rules using the Azure Resource Manager CLI with [templates](./alerts-log-create-templates.md)

```azurecli
az login
az deployment group create \
    --name AlertDeployment \
    --resource-group ResourceGroupofTargetResource \
    --template-file mylogalerttemplate.json \
    --parameters @mylogalerttemplate.parameters.json
```

A 201 response is returned on successful creation. 200 is returned on successful updates.

## Manage log search alert rules with PowerShell

Log search alert rules have this dedicated PowerShell cmdlet:
- [New-AzScheduledQueryRule](/powershell/module/az.monitor/new-azscheduledqueryrule): Creates a new log search alert rule or updates an existing log search alert rule.

## Check the number of log alert rules in use

### In the Azure portal
1. On the Alerts screen in Azure Monitor, select **Alert rules**.
1. In the **Subscription** dropdown control, filter to the subscription you want. (Make sure you don't filter to a specific resource group, resource type, or resource.)
1. In the **Signal type** dropdown control, select **Log Search**.
1. Verify that the **Status** dropdown control is set to **Enabled**.

The total number of log search alert rules is displayed above the rules list.
