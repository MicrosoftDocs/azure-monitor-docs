# Delete unused ITSM connectors

The process of deleting unused IT service management (ITSM) connectors has two phases. You delete all the actions that are associated with an ITSM connector, and then you delete the connector itself. You delete the actions first because actions without a connector might cause errors in your subscription.

## Delete associated actions

1. In the Azure portal, select Monitor, then **Alerts** and **Action groups**.

Monitor in the portal menu, Alerts on the left pane, and Action groups button are highlighted.":::

1. Select the action group associated with the ITSM Connector you want to delete.
