# Tutorial: Create a metric alert for an Azure resource

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. Metric alert rules create an alert when a metric value from an Azure resource exceeds a threshold.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a metric alert rule from metrics explorer
> * Configure the alert threshold
> * Create an action group to define notification details

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial you need the following: 

- An Azure resource to monitor. You can use any resource in your Azure subscription that supports metrics. To determine whether a resource supports metrics, go to its menu in the Azure portal and verify that there's a **Metrics** option in the **Monitoring** section of the menu.
- Chart in metrics explorer with one or more metrics that you want to alert on. Complete [Tutorial: Analyze metrics for an Azure resource](../essentials/tutorial-metrics.md).

## Create new alert rule
From metrics explorer, click **New alert rule**. The rule will be preconfigured with the target object and the metric that you selected in metrics explorer.

## Configure alert logic
The resource will already be selected. You need to modify the signal logic to specify the threshold value and any other details for the alert rule. 

To view these settings, select the **Condition** tab.

The chart shows the value of the selected signal over time so that you can see when the alert would have been fired. This chart will update as you specify the signal logic.

The **Alert logic** is defined by the condition and the evaluation time. The alert fires when this condition is true. Provide a **Threshold value** for your alert rule and modify the **Operator** and **Aggregation type** to define the logic you need.

You can accept the default time granularity or modify it to your requirements. **Check every** defines how often the alert rule will check if the condition is met. **Lookback period** defines the time interval over which the collected values are aggregated. For example, every 5 minutes, youâ€™ll be looking at the past 5 minutes.

When you're done configuring the signal logic, click **Next: Actions >** or the **Actions** tab to configure actions.

## Configure actions
[!INCLUDE [Action groups](../../../includes/azure-monitor-tutorial-action-group.md)]

## Configure details
[!INCLUDE [Alert details](../../../includes/azure-monitor-tutorial-alert-details.md)]

Click **Review + create** and then **Create** to create the alert rule.
