# Create or edit an activity log, service health, or resource health alert rule

This article shows you how to create or edit an activity log, service health, or resource health alert rule in Azure Monitor. To learn more about alerts, see the [alerts overview](alerts-overview.md).

You create an alert rule by combining the resources to be monitored, the monitoring data from the resource, and the conditions that you want to trigger the alert. You can then define [action groups](./action-groups.md) and [alert processing rules](alerts-action-rules.md) to determine what happens when an alert is triggered.

Alerts triggered by these alert rules contain a payload that uses the [common alert schema](alerts-common-schema.md).

    This table describes the available services for activity log alert rules:
