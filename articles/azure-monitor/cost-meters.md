# Azure Monitor billing meter names

This article contains a reference of the billing meter names used by Azure Monitor in [Azure Cost Management + Billing](cost-usage.md#azure-cost-management--billing). Use this information to interpret your monthly charges for Azure Monitor.

## Log data ingestion
The following table lists the meters used to bill for data ingestion in your Log Analytics workspaces, and whether the meter is regional. There's a different billing meter, `MeterId` in the export usage report for each region. Note that Basic Logs ingestion can be used when the workspace's pricing tier is Pay-as-you-go or any commitment tier.

The **Free Benefit - M365 Defender Data Ingestion** meter is used to record the benefit from the [Microsoft Sentinel benefit for Microsoft 365 E5, A5, F5, and G5 customers](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/sentinel-microsoft-365-offer/).

### Legacy Application Insights meters

Most Application Insights usage for both classic and workspace-based resources is reported on meters with **Log Analytics** for **Meter Category** because there's a single log back-end for all Azure Monitor components. Only Application Insights resources on legacy pricing tiers and multiple-step web tests are reported with **Application Insights** for **Meter Category**. The usage is shown in the **Consumed Quantity** column. The unit for each entry is shown in the **Unit of Measure** column. For more information, see [Understand your Microsoft Azure bill](/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/review-individual-bill).

To separate costs from your Log Analytics and classic Application Insights usage, [create a filter](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/group-filter) on **Resource type**. To see all Application Insights costs, filter **Resource type** to **microsoft.insights/components**. For Log Analytics costs, filter **Resource type** to **microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces**. (Workspace-based Application Insights is all billed to the Log Analytics workspace resourced.)
