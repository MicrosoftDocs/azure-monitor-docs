## Troubleshooting

### Metric category isn't supported

When deploying a diagnostic setting, you receive an error message, similar to *Metric category 'xxxx' is not supported*. You may receive this error even though your previous deployment succeeded. 

The problem occurs when using a Resource Manager template, REST API, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. Diagnostic settings created via the Azure portal aren't affected as only the supported category names are presented.

Metric categories other than `AllMetrics` aren't supported except for a limited number of Azure services. Previously other category names were ignored when deploying a diagnostic setting, redirecting them to `AllMetrics`. As of February 2021, the metric category provided is validated. This change caused some deployments to fail.

To fix this issue, update your deployments to remove any metric category names other than `AllMetrics`. If the deployment adds multiple categories, use only one `AllMetrics` category. If you continue to have the problem, contact Azure support through the Azure portal. 

### Setting disappears due to non-ASCII characters in resourceID

Diagnostic settings don't support resourceIDs with non-ASCII characters (for example, Preproducc√≥n). Since you can't rename resources in Azure, you must create a new resource without the non-ASCII characters. If the characters are in a resource group, you can move the resources to a new group.

### Possibility of duplicated or dropped data

Every effort is made to ensure all log data is sent correctly to your destinations, however it's not possible to guarantee 100% data transfer of logs between endpoints. Retries and other mechanisms are in place to work around these issues and attempt to ensure log data arrives at the endpoint.

### Inactive resources

When a resource is inactive and exporting zero-value metrics, the diagnostic settings export mechanism backs off incrementally to avoid unnecessary costs of exporting and storing zero values. The back-off may lead to a delay in the export of the next non-zero value. 

When a resource is inactive for one hour, the export mechanism backs off to 15 minutes. This means that there is a potential latency of up to 15 minutes for the next nonzero value to be exported. The maximum backoff time of two hours is reached after seven days of inactivity. Once the resource starts exporting nonzero values, the export mechanism reverts to the original export latency of three minutes. 

This behavior only applies to exported metrics and doesn't affect metrics-based alerts or autoscale.
