# Azure Monitor AIOPs overview

The article provides an introduction to Azure Monitor's Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) capabilities. It explains how AIOps uses machine learning to enhance service quality and reliability by analyzing data from applications, services, and IT resources. Key features include capacity prediction, autoscaling, performance issue analysis, and anomaly detection.

## What is Azure Monitor AIOPs

Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) in Azure Monitor uses machine learning to enhance service quality and reliability. It processes data from applications, services, and IT resources to provide actionable insights and automate tasks like capacity prediction, autoscaling, performance issue analysis, and anomaly detection in resources such as virtual machines and containers.

Azure Monitor also enables you to create custom machine learning pipelines for advanced analysis and automated responses using Azure Monitor Logs.
