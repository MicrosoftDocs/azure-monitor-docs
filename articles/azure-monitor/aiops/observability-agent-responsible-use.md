# Responsible AI FAQ for Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview)

This article explains the responsible use of Azure Monitor Observability Agent and investigation capabilities.

## What is Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview)?

Azure Monitor Observability Agent is an advanced AIOps solution that helps IT operations teams efficiently find, troubleshoot, and resolve incidents. It uses AI and machine learning to automate the investigation process, offering insights and recommendations for issue mitigation based on data such as platform metrics and custom metrics. For an overview of how Observability Agent works and a summary of capabilities, see the [Azure Monitor Observability Agent overview](observability-agent-overview.md) and [Azure Monitor issues and investigations overview](aiops-issue-and-investigation-overview.md)

## Are Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview) results reliable?

Azure Monitor Observability Agent is designed to generate the best possible suggestions based on the data and context to which it has access. However, like any AI-powered system, its responses might not always be perfect. The results generated by Observability Agent should be carefully evaluated, tested, and validated before being deployed to your Azure environment.

## How does Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview) use data from my Azure environment?

Azure Monitor Observability Agent analyzes data within your Azure environment to generate responses. Observability Agent only has access to resources that you have access to and can only perform actions that you have the permissions to perform. Observability Agent operates within the constraints of your existing access management controls, such as Azure Role-Based Action Control, Privileged Identity Management, Azure Policy, and resource locks.

## What data does Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview) collect?

Azure Monitor Observability Agent doesn't use user-provided prompts or its own responses to train or improve the underlying AI models. User engagement data, such as the number of sessions, session duration, selected skills, and feedback, might be collected to improve Microsoft products and services, subject to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) and explicit user consent.

## What should I do if I see unexpected or offensive content?

Azure Monitor Observability Agent development is guided by our [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach) and [Responsible AI Standard](https://aka.ms/RAIStandardPDF). We have prioritized mitigating exposing customers to offensive content. However, you might still see unexpected results. We continually work to improve the technology to prevent such content.

## How current is the information Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview) provides?

Azure Monitor Observability Agent uses the latest data available to provide the most recent information. While there might be some lag in the data coming in to the monitoring system, it generally provides current information.

## Do all Azure services have the same level of integration with Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview)?

No. Our goal is to provide the same level of integration of Azure Monitor Observability Agent with all Azure services. We're continuously working to add more Observability Agent integrations with more Azure services.

## What are the fairness considerations in the development of Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview)?

Fairness is a core part of Azure Monitor Observability Agent's development. Consistent performance across different scenarios and input data types is critical. The system is evaluated for fairness harms, including monitoring log probabilities for answer reliability and checking for incorrect output. Measures are taken to prevent harmful generated text and ensure that fallback options are in place when AI encounters issues like a timeout or service unavailability.

## How should I integrate Azure Monitor Observability Agent (preview) into my workflow?

To integrate Azure Monitor Observability Agent effectively into your operations, it's important to understand its capabilities and limitations. Testing using real data from your environment helps to evaluate its performance. Ensure that SREs are trained in the system's intended uses, how to interact with it, and when to rely on human judgment over automated output. This balanced approach maximizes the benefits of Observability Agent while maintaining oversight and control.
