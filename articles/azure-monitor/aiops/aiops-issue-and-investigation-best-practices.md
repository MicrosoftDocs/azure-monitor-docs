# Best Practices Guide: Azure Monitor issues and investigations (preview)

Azure Monitor’s **[issues and investigations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/aiops/aiops-issue-and-investigation-overview)** feature leverages AI to analyze your Application Insights telemetry and help troubleshoot problems. By following these best practices, you can ensure the investigations have rich data to produce most relevant insights.

## Capture All Requests, Dependencies, and Exceptions Telemetry 
Make sure **all key telemetry types** from your application are being collected:
- **Requests** (incoming HTTP calls) – The Application Insights SDKs automatically track web requests for many frameworks (e.g. ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core) by default.  
- **Dependencies** (outbound calls to external services) – Most SDKs auto-collect common dependencies (HTTP calls, SQL calls, etc.) if configured correctly. For example, the .NET Application Insights SDK enables a Dependency Tracking module that automatically logs HTTP calls, database queries, and more. In other environments like Python, some dependencies might **not** be captured out-of-the-box. Check the documentation for your framework, and if a dependency isn’t collected automatically, use the telemetry client API to track it manually (e.g. `track_dependency` in Python or `TrackDependency` in .NET). This ensures that Azure Monitor is aware of calls your service makes to databases, APIs, storage accounts, etc.  
- **Exceptions** – Unhandled exceptions are automatically recorded by the SDK in most setups. However, if you are catching exceptions in your code, be sure to log them to Application Insights (for example, by calling `TelemetryClient.TrackException`) or rethrow them after logging. Every error should surface as an exception telemetry in Application Insights; otherwise the investigation might miss important failure signals.

> **Note:** Each of these telemetry types (requests, dependencies, exceptions) is used by Azure Monitor’s AI to identify anomalies and failure patterns. For instance, investigations analyze the top failure events across requests, dependencies, and exceptions. If any one of these is missing (e.g. you never see dependency data because it wasn’t instrumented), the investigation’s coverage will be incomplete. [See  details on which dependencies are collected by default and how to manually track custom ones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-dependencies#automatically-tracked-dependencies).

## Allow Unhandled Exceptions to Bubble Up 
Ensure that **unhandled exceptions bubble up** to the Application Insights SDK or OpenTelemetry so they can be recorded. In practice, this means you should avoid catching exceptions without logging or rethrowing them. If an exception occurs, let it propagate or explicitly track it. This way, the built-in telemetry modules can observe the exception and send it to Application Insights. Failing to do so results in errors that Azure Monitor investigations won’t see at all. The investigation AI relies on exception telemetry to pinpoint issues (for example, identifying a spike in failures caused by a specific exception). Make it a rule that no critical exception gets swallowed silently. If you use a global error handler, have it log exceptions via `TelemetryClient.TrackException` or the equivalent OpenTelemetry call. This ensures Azure Monitor will know an error occurred and include it in the investigation findings.

## Use the Latest Application Insights SDK or OpenTelemetry Distro 
Always **use the latest official** Azure Monitor **OpenTelemetry SDK or Application Insights SDK** for your application. Newer versions contain important fixes, performance improvements, and support for the latest telemetry data models. Using the latest version ensures your app’s telemetry is compatible with the AI analysis engine and that you’re sending all the necessary signals. For example, newer SDKs may automatically capture additional metrics or context that older versions don’t. The Azure Monitor team recommends adopting the OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation for new applications, as it is the future for Application Insights. Older SDK versions might also collect telemetry in less efficient ways. (For instance, an outdated .NET SDK might emit too many counters as custom metrics, whereas newer versions let you filter those out.) Upgrading gives you better control and alignment with best practices. In short, staying up-to-date on instrumentation SDKs ensures you get **full feature support** (for example, automatic dependency tracking for newer Azure services) and the latest bug fixes for accurate data. It also means your telemetry will include all the fields that Azure Monitor’s investigation feature expects. Always review the SDK release notes and upgrade your NuGet/NPM/PyPI packages or OpenTelemetry distro to the latest stable release. (If you’re migrating from the classic SDK to OpenTelemetry, see the official [Application Insights OpenTelemetry data collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-configuration) documentation for guidance.)

## Set Cloud Role Name for Each Microservice 
If your application is composed of multiple services or components, **assign a distinct cloud role name** to each one. The *cloud role name* is a telemetry property that identifies the logical component or microservice that emitted the telemetry. Setting this is critical for distributed applications – it allows Azure Monitor to group telemetry by service. In the Azure portal’s Application Map, for example, each node is labeled with the cloud role name. During an investigation, having proper role names means the AI can distinguish which component an anomaly originates from. Without it, data from all services might be mixed together, making the analysis less clear.

By default, the Application Insights SDK and Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry will try to populate a role name (for instance, using the cloud service name or entry assembly name). However, it’s best to **override it with a meaningful name for your app’s architecture**. For example, set “OrderingService”, “InventoryAPI”, etc., as the role names rather than generic defaults. In code, you can set this via configuration or a Telemetry Initializer. In .NET you might do: `TelemetryClient.Context.Cloud.RoleName = "InventoryAPI";`. In OpenTelemetry (Azure Monitor distro), you can configure resource attributes like `service.name` and `service.namespace` which determine the cloud role name and instance. [See how to do this in different languages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-configuration#set-the-cloud-role-name-and-the-cloud-role-instance).

**Why is this important?** Azure Monitor investigations will correlate events across your microservices. If each telemetry item knows which microservice it came from, the investigation can identify, for example, that “Service A experienced slow dependencies resulting in failures in Service B.” You’ll get a clearer picture of cross-service issues. Therefore, consistently set the cloud role name for all components – including background services and functions – so that your distributed telemetry is properly segregated by role.

## Use Consistent and Predictable Resource Naming 
Use a **standard naming convention for your Azure resources** (and components within your telemetry) so that their purpose is clear and machine-readable. Consistent naming is an Azure best practice in general, but here we highlight that it even helps the AI in Azure Monitor. When resource names are predictable and include key context, the investigation summaries and correlations become easier to understand.

Consider following the [guidelines for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming). For example, include an indicator of the resource type and a meaningful identifier in the name (like `prod-web-eastus-001` for a web app). Also, [refer to the official list of resource abbreviations to keep names concise yet informative](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations).

**Why this matters for investigations:** The AI-generated investigation summary will mention resource names involved in an issue. If those names are clear, you (and even the AI model generating explanations) can more easily infer the role of each resource. For instance, a finding might say *“VM `vm-app-prod-01` experienced high CPU…”* – a name like `vm-app-prod-01` already tells you this is a production app server VM. If it was named obscurely (e.g. `contoso123`), the summary would be harder to interpret. Moreover, consistent naming across resources implies structure; the AI might group related resources by name patterns (for example, noticing multiple components with “inventory” in their name).

Additionally, within telemetry, if you use custom dimensions or cloud role names, apply consistent naming to those as well. Use the same terminology as your resource names when appropriate. The goal is to avoid confusion and make it straightforward to connect the dots. Azure Monitor’s analysis does incorporate resource metadata (like resource type), but a good name helps everyone – humans and AI – quickly grasp the scenario.

In short, adopt a naming convention and stick to it. It’s a simple step that leads to more readable investigation outputs and smoother collaboration (when you share an issue with others, they can readily identify resources from the names). If you need guidance, use the linked documentation for best practices and abbreviation standards.

## Include Resource Context in Your Telemetry for Auto-Scoping

Azure Monitor’s investigation feature can **automatically expand its scope to related resources** when it detects relevant signals. You can help this process by including resource identifiers in your telemetry. In practice, this means: when your code interacts with an Azure resource (or any external resource), provide some identifier of that resource in the telemetry data. 

**Example:** Suppose your app calls an Azure Storage queue or an Azure SQL Database. If you use the Application Insights SDK’s dependency tracking, it will log the target endpoint (e.g. the queue URL or database name) automatically. Make sure this feature is enabled, as it inherently carries the resource identity (like the Azure resource’s name or URL) in the dependency telemetry. In custom logging scenarios, you might add a custom property like `"AzureResourceId"` or include the resource name in the telemetry message. 

In modern cloud environments, especially if your application runs on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, it’s important to capture the cluster context in your telemetry as well. Many microservices running on AKS today do not tag their telemetry with cluster or pod information, which limits Azure Monitor’s ability to connect application issues with cluster-level events. To address this:

- **Use AKS autoinstrumentation (Preview) when possible:** For Java and Node.js workloads on AKS, Azure Monitor offers a codeless autoinstrumentation feature that injects the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry agent into your pods without code changes. This automatically enriches your telemetry with cluster metadata (such as cluster name, namespace, and pod identifiers) along with application data. (See [Monitor applications on AKS with Azure Monitor Application Insights (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless) for how to enable this feature.)

- **Manually add cluster metadata for other scenarios:** If autoinstrumentation isn’t available for your tech stack (for example, .NET or Python apps on AKS), instrument your application with the Application Insights SDK or OpenTelemetry as usual, but include Kubernetes context as custom dimensions. For instance, .NET services can use the [ApplicationInsights.Kubernetes GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Kubernetes) (an official library) to automatically attach cluster name, namespace, pod, and node information to each telemetry item. In any language, you can also implement a Telemetry Initializer or similar mechanism to add these details to every telemetry event.

By providing such resource context (like specific resource IDs or cluster details), you enable Azure Monitor to perform *auto-scoping* — including those related resources in the investigation analysis. This leads to more comprehensive investigations that consider not just your application, but also upstream or underlying infrastructure components that might be contributing to the problem. For instance, if a spike in failures in your app coincides with a node issue or pod restarts in your AKS cluster, the investigation can surface that connection if it has the cluster context. In short, always strive to instrument with resource context in mind so the AI has the full picture during troubleshooting.

## Avoid Overriding Telemetry Properties – Use Custom Dimensions 
Application Insights telemetry items come with a set of standard properties (context fields) such as operation ID, operation name, user ID, session ID, cloud role, etc. **Do not override or repurpose these built-in properties for custom data**. Doing so can confuse the telemetry correlation and the investigation analysis. Instead, attach any custom business data as **custom dimensions** (also known as custom properties).

**Why:** The standard telemetry context fields are used by Azure Monitor for specific purposes. For example, the `operation_Id` and `operation_ParentId` tie together related calls in a distributed trace, `user_Id` and `session_Id` help group user sessions, and so on. If one were to override, say, the operation name or user ID with some application-specific meaning, you would break the intended usage – and the AI might not correctly correlate events anymore. (See the [Application Insights telemetry data model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-model-complete) for reference on these fields and their roles.)

**Best practice:** When you have additional info to log (like an order ID, or customer tier, or any domain-specific context), use the telemetry API to add a custom property. For instance, with the .NET SDK you can add custom key-value pairs via the `Properties` dictionary on a telemetry item (`TrackEvent(..., properties)` or `TrackTrace(..., properties)`). These will appear as custom dimensions in the logs. Similarly, in other languages or OpenTelemetry, you can attach attributes/tags to spans or logs. By keeping your data in custom dimensions, you ensure the built-in schema remains intact for Azure Monitor’s use. 

This approach keeps standard telemetry consistent and still allows you to enrich data. Azure Monitor investigations will include custom dimensions in the evidence when relevant, but more importantly you won’t unintentionally disrupt how telemetry is correlated. For example, if you want to mark a request with a specific business transaction ID, don’t try to hijack the operation ID; instead, add it as a separate property (e.g. `"TransactionId"`). This way, the investigation can still follow the operation ID to link the request with dependencies and exceptions, and your custom “TransactionId” will simply be additional context.

In short, **treat the default telemetry properties as reserved** – set them only to their intended values. Put any extra info into custom dimensions. This yields clean, well-structured telemetry that the AI can use effectively.

## Instrument Critical Operations with Custom Events and Operations 
Not every important activity in your application is captured by default instrumentation. **Instrument the critical parts of your code** – especially those that handle background processing, queue messages, or any significant business logic – by using custom telemetry like *TrackEvent* and *StartOperation*. This ensures that meaningful operations are visible to Azure Monitor.

**Use TrackEvent (custom events)** for logging high-level business or functional events. For example, you might track an event when an order is placed or when a batch job starts. These events can include custom dimensions for detail (e.g. OrderID, amount). They are useful for investigations because they mark notable occurrences in your system beyond the basic request flow. If an issue is related to a specific sequence (say, processing a queue message), having custom events for "QueueMessageReceived" or "QueueMessageProcessed" could help the investigation pinpoint where things went wrong. (At minimum, it helps **you** correlate where in the flow an anomaly happened by looking at the timeline of events.)

**Use StartOperation/StopOperation (custom operations)** to trace long-running or asynchronous processes that span beyond a single request or dependency call. The Application Insights .NET SDK provides a `StartOperation<T>` API which creates a new telemetry operation (such as a `RequestTelemetry` or `DependencyTelemetry`) with its own duration and context. You can use this to manually demarcate an operation, track telemetry within its scope, then complete it. For example, if your service pulls a message from an Azure Queue and processes it, you can treat that process as a custom operation: start a telemetry operation when you begin processing the queue message, and stop it when done. Within that scope, any tracked sub-calls or exceptions can be correlated to that operation. This gives a complete picture of that unit of work. Azure Monitor will then treat it similar to a request: you’ll see it in the portal with its duration, success/failure, child dependencies, etc., which the investigation can analyze like any other request.

**Pattern:** Many patterns like queue processing, batch jobs, or scheduled tasks require manual instrumentation because they aren’t HTTP requests that the SDK auto-collects. Identify these in your app and add telemetry accordingly. Use `TelemetryClient.StartOperation()` in .NET (or the equivalent in other languages) to begin tracking, and ensure you call `StopOperation()` (or dispose the operation) so that the telemetry is sent with the correct timing. Within that operation, use `TrackException`, `TrackEvent`, `TrackTrace` as needed to log details. 

By instrumenting key workflows:
- You make invisible processes visible to Azure Monitor. 
- Investigations can then consider these custom operations and events. For instance, if a particular background task causes an issue, the telemetry from StartOperation will show it clearly, possibly surfacing as a finding (“An issue occurred during the nightly sync job at 2AM”). 
- You also get more granular insight for yourself to troubleshoot outside of the AI as well.

For more on this, see the guide [Track custom operations with Application Insights .NET SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/custom-operations-tracking), which provides patterns for manual operation tracking (incoming request simulation, queuing scenarios, etc.), and [this about using TrackEvent and other APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics).

## Collect and Trace Detailed Logs in Application Insights 
Enable collection of **trace logs** (log messages) in your Application Insights telemetry, and use them wisely. Traces (also called logs) are textual messages emitted by your application – for example, debug or info logs that you write via a logger. These won’t directly raise alerts, but they provide a **breadcrumb trail** of what the application was doing, which can be invaluable during an investigation.

**How to ensure trace collection:** If you’re using .NET, make sure Application Insights is integrated with your logging framework (ILogger, log4net, NLog, etc.) or use `TelemetryClient.TrackTrace` for important messages. In Java, Node.js, Python and other platforms, integrate the Azure Monitor exporter or OpenTelemetry SDK with your logging system, or explicitly send trace telemetry. (For instance, Python’s Azure Monitor integration can capture the standard logging module records, and for other languages you might use OpenTelemetry logging instrumentation.) The goal is that your **diagnostic messages end up in the Application Insights “traces” table** in Azure Monitor. Check that you can see your log messages in the portal (under **Logs > traces**). If not, follow the platform-specific docs on enabling Application Insights log collection (for example, see [Explore .NET trace logs in Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-trace-logs) for .NET, or use the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro for languages like Java and Python).

**Why it matters:** During an investigation, trace logs are analyzed with every abnormal event. For example, if an investigation finding shows a spike in exceptions, relevant trace logs help refine the finding result (perhaps a specific operation was underway, or a certain input was processed). Well-placed trace statements (like entering a function, values of certain variables, or completion of certain steps) can shed light on the cause of an anomaly. They act as breadcrumbs for you and can sometimes be used by the AI summarization to provide the possible explaination and what to do next.

**Best practices for traces:** Collect at least `Information`-level logs and above in production (you can adjust verbosity as needed). Include relevant context in your log messages, but avoid overly verbose logging that could overwhelm signal vs. noise. Make sure each log has some contextual identifiers (like an operation ID or correlation ID – which Application Insights will attach automatically if using the SDK’s logging integration). Traces are especially useful when paired with custom operations or events – log inside your critical sections so you know what’s happening step by step.

In summary, **don’t rely solely on high-level telemetry**. The fine-grained trace data often provides the “why” to the investigation’s “what.” Enable trace collection and use it to your advantage when diagnosing issues surfaced by Azure Monitor.

## Create Application Insights Availability Tests 
Set up **availability tests** for your application using Application Insights. Availability tests (also known as web tests or ping tests) proactively ping your application’s endpoints from various locations on a schedule. They help detect downtime or extreme slowdowns early, and they integrate with Azure Monitor alerts. By creating availability tests, you ensure that if your app becomes unreachable, an alert will fire and Azure Monitor can kick off an investigation into the issue.

**How to use:** In Application Insights, you can create different types of availability tests:
- A simple URL ping test (now superseded by the Standard test) which hits a given URL and checks if it responds successfully within a timeout.
- Standard availability tests, which allow more configuration (HTTP method, success criteria, etc.).
- Multi-step tests (sequence of steps) – these are older and have been deprecated in favor of simpler tests or custom approaches.

For most purposes, setting up a couple of Standard availability tests on your key endpoints (e.g. home page, login API, critical health check) is advised. You can do this in the Azure Portal under your Application Insights resource’s **Availability** pane. Choose the test type, frequency (e.g. every 5 minutes), and test locations around the world. **Enable alerts** for test failures so that an Azure Monitor alert is generated when an endpoint is down.

**Why it’s important:** Azure Monitor investigations support Application Insights alerts, which include availability
