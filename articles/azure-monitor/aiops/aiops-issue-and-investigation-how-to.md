# Use Azure Monitor issue and investigation (preview)

This article shows you how to use Azure Monitor issues and investigations (preview) to trigger an investigation to identify resource issues, and to explain why an alert was fired, and provide next steps to mitigate and resolve problems with Azure resources.

> [!NOTE]
> For preview, the only alert supported is an Application Insights resource alert.

## Prerequisites

- Read the [Azure Monitor issue and investigation (preview) overview](aiops-issue-and-investigation-overview.md).
- Learn about the [responsible use](aiops-issue-and-investigation-responsible-use.md) of Azure Monitor investigation.
- Assign either the *Contributor*, *Monitoring Contributor, or Issue Contributor* role to the resource youâ€™re investigating.
- Trigger an alert.

## Ways to start an investigation on an alert

There are two ways to start an investigation on an alert:

1.  From the home page in the Azure portal:
    1.  From the home page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Monitor** \> **Alerts**.
    2.  From the **Alerts** page, select the alert that you want to investigate.
    3.  In the alert details pane, select **Investigate (preview)**.
2.  From the alert email notification: Alternatively, you can select **Investigate (preview)** from the email notification about an alert. An issue is created, and the investigation begins.

When the investigation is complete, a set of findings is displayed. For next steps, see the [Working with investigations](#work-with-investigation-findings) section of this article.

## Change the settings of an issue

You can change the settings of an issue using the dropdowns on the overview tab of the issue page.

- **Severity.** The severity of an issue can be verbose, informational, error, warning or critical.
- **Status.** The status of an issue can be New, In-Progress, Mitigated, Resolved, Closed, Canceled or On-Hold.
- **Impact time.** You can change the impact time of the issue. Changing the impact time automatically initiates a new investigation using the updated time.

## Share a link to the issue

An investigation will present findings based on the evidence it analyzed.
