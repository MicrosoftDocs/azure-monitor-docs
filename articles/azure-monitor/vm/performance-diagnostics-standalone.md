### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or a later version, must be installed on the VM. 
  > [!Note]
  > Python 2 is no longer supported by the Python Software Foundation (PSF). If Python 2.7 is installed on the VM, PerfInsights can be installed. However, no changes or bug fixes will be made in PerfInsights to support Python 2.7. For more information, see [Sunsetting Python 2](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).

## Next steps

You can upload diagnostics logs and reports to Microsoft Support for further review. Support might request that you transmit the output that is generated by PerfInsights to assist with the troubleshooting process.
