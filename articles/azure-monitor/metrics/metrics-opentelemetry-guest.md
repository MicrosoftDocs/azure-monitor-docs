# OpenTelemetry Guest OS Metrics (preview)

At Microsoft, we embrace Open Standards through adoption and support of OpenTelemetry metrics stored in Azure Monitor Workspaces(AMW), with Prometheus Query Language(PromQl) our foundational metrics query language across all AMW metrics. 

Before reading this article, users are recommended to first understand the difference between [Host OS vs Guest OS performance counters on virtual machines](/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm). 

This article is about Guest OS performance counters that users must opt-in to collecting, either via Azure Monitor Agent with DCR, VM Insights with DCR, or user-collected with the OTelCollector as part of OTel instrumentation libraries. Users are recommended to store all metrics in the metrics-optimized Azure Monitor Workspace, where they are cheaper and faster to query than in Log Analytics Workspaces. 
 
This article provides users with the following information:
* [Overview of performance counters](#performance-counters)
* [Benefits of using OpenTelemetry system metrics](#benefits-of-opentelemetry)
* [Benefits of using Azure Monitor Workspace for metrics](#benefits-of-azure-monitor-workspace)
* [Comparison of OpenTelemetry naming convention to traditional performance counters](#performance-counter-names)
* [Resource Attributes](#resource-attributes)

OpenTelemetry Guest OS Performance Counters are currently in public preview.

## Performance Counters

Both Windows and Linux provide users with OS-level metrics related to CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, networking and more to help diagnose performance issues. You can easily see an example on your local machine right now by using [Performance Monitor(perfmon)](/windows/win32/perfctrs/performance-counters-portal) on Windows or by using the [*perf* command](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/developer_guide/perf) on Linux. 

The total number of available OS performance counters is dynamic, with Windows providing [~1846 OS performance counters](/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/rebuild-performance-counter-library-values) by default and several more available based on the local machine available hardware, software, and tracepoint events.

A subset of OpenTelemetry Metrics are known as [system metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/system/system-metrics/). System metrics are essentially another name for performance counters; they are an Open Source Standard for consistent naming and formatting of performance counters and do not add any net-new OS performance counters.  

## Benefits of OpenTelemetry

**Cross-OS observability**
The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for system metrics streamlines the cross-OS end user experience by converging Windows and Linux performance counters into a consistent naming convention and metric data model. This makes it easier for users to manage their virtual machines / nodes across their fleet with a single set of queries used for either Windows or Linux OS images. The same configuration-as-code (ARM/Bicep templates, Terraform, etc) using the same PromQl queries can be used for any hosting resource that adopts OpenTelemetry system metrics. 

**More performance counters**
The OpenTelemetry Collector Host Metrics Receiver collects many more performance counters than Azure Monitor currently makes available for collection via DCR with Log Analytics workspace as a destination. For example, users can now monitor per-process CPU utilization, disk I/O, memory usage and more.

**Fewer performance counters**
In many scenarios, existing performance counters have been simplified into a single OTel system metric with metric dimensions [(Resource Attributes)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#timeseries-model) simplifying the user experience.

For example, the CPU time in different states can surface as the following three performance counters in Windows:
* \Processor Information(_Total )\% Processor Time
* \Processor Information(_Total)\% Privileged Time
* \Processor Information(_Total)\% User Time
or as the following seven performance counters in Linux:
* Cpu/usage_user
* Cpu/usage_system
* Cpu/usage_idle
* Cpu/usage_active
* Cpu/usage_nice
* Cpu/usage_iowait
* Cpu/usage_irq

In OpenTelemetry, all of these counters become a single performance counter: system.cpu.time, and the time spent in each state (such as user, system, idle) can now be found by simply filtering on the dimension *State*.

## Benefits of Azure Monitor Workspace

Metrics stored in Azure Monitor workspaces are cheaper and faster to query than when stored in Log Analytics workspaces, due to the different data models backing these different data stores. 

In addition to those general benefits, users no longer experience mismatches in schemas between the Perf and Insights tables. VM Insights (v2) sending to AMW uses a subset of the OpenTelemetry system metrics we make available to users, providing seamless compatibility across user cohorts. Large enterprises with application teams that use a mix of VM Insights and non-VM Insights Guest OS performance counter monitoring can use the same PromQl queries, dashboards, and alerts for the same OTel metrics.

## Performance Counter Names 

The following performance counters are collected by the Azure Monitor Agent for Windows and Linux virtual machines. The default sampling frequency is 60 seconds, but this frequency can be changed when creating or updating the data collection rule.

> [!TIP]
> Feel free to share your feedback on new performance counters or functionality you would like to see by posting to our [Github Community](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureMonitorCommunity/discussions) or via [Portal feedback](/answers/questions/564554/where-can-i-submit-suggestions-for-azure).

## Resource Attributes

The OpenTelemetry [Resource semantic convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/) is still in development. We are actively engaging with the OSS community to improve and standardize this naming convention for a variety of scenarios - please share your feedback to help us continuously improve your experience.

In general, OpenTelemetry metrics collected via Azure Monitor Agent + Data Collection Rules and sent to Azure Monitor workspaces have the following cloud resource attributes automatically added as dimensions to support resource-scoped querying:
 * Microsoft.resourceid
 * Microsoft.subscriptionid
 * Microsoft.resourcegroupname
 * Microsoft.resourcetype
 * Microsoft.amwresourceid

OpenTelemetry [**per-process** metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/internal/scraper/processscraper/documentation.md#process) have their own special set of [Resource Attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/internal/scraper/processscraper/documentation.md#resource-attributes). The table shows those resource attributes that the Azure Monitor Agent automatically promotes as dimensions.

| Name | Description | Values | Enabled | 
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| process.command | The command used to launch the process (i.e., the command name). On Linux-based systems, can be set to the zeroth string in `proc/[pid]/cmdline`. On Windows, can be set to the first parameter extracted from `GetCommandLineW`. | Any Str | true |
 process.executable.name  | The name of the process executable. On Linux-based systems, can be set to the `Name` in `proc/[pid]/status`. On Windows, can be set to the base name of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`. | Any Str | true |
| process.owner            | The username of the user that owns the process. | Any Str | true |
| process.pid              | Process identifier (PID). | Any Int | true |
| process.cgroup           | cgroup associated with the process (Linux only). | Any Str | false |
| process.command_line     | The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing the full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetCommandLineW`. Do not set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use `process.command_args` instead. | Any Str | false |
| process.executable.path  | The full path to the process executable. On Linux-based systems, can be set to the target of `proc/[pid]/exe`. On Windows, can be set to the result of `GetProcessImageFileNameW`. | Any Str | false |
| process.parent_pid | Parent Process Identifier (PPID). | Any Int | false |

The process.command_line attribute can contain extremely long strings with thousands of characters, making it unsuitable as a normal metric dimension. We might find a different way to surface this attribute based on customer user scenarios submitted as feedback to the product team.
