### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create availability alert rules for Azure VMs.
> - Create agent heartbeat alert rule to verify agent health.
> - Configure data collection and alerting for monitoring reliability of client workflows.

### Configuration recommendations

| Recommendation | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Create availability alert rules for Azure VMs. | Use the [availability metric (preview)](../vm/tutorial-monitor-vm-alert-availability.md) to track when an Azure VM is running. While you can quickly enable an availability alert rule for an individual machine using [recommended alerts](../vm/tutorial-monitor-vm-alert-recommended.md), a single alert rule targeting a resource group or subscription enables availability alerting for all VMs in that scope for a particular region. This is easier to manage than creating an alert rule for each VM and ensures that any new VMs created in the scope are automatically monitored. This alert rule doesn't require the Azure Monitor agent to be installed on the VM, but it isn't available for VMs outside of Azure. |
| Create agent heartbeat alert rule to verify agent health. | The Azure Monitor agent sends a heartbeat to the Log Analytics workspace every minute. Use a log search alert rule [using the agent heartbeat](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-alerts.md#agent-heartbeat) to be alerted when an agent stops sending heartbeats, which is an indicator that either the VM is down or the agent is unhealthy and client workloads aren't being monitored. This alert rule requires that the Azure Monitor agent is installed on the VM and applies to both Azure and non-Azure VMs. |
| Configure data collection and alerting for monitoring reliability of client workflows. | Use the information at Monitor virtual machines with [Monitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Collect data](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-data-collection.md) to configure client event collection indicating potential issues with your client workloads. Use the information at Monitor virtual machines with [Monitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Alerts](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-alerts.md) to create alert rules to be proactively notified of any potential operational issues with your client workloads. |
