### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Configure access for different types of data in the workspace required for different roles in your organization.
> - Use Azure private link to remove access to your workspace from public networks.
> - Configure log query auditing to track which users are running queries.
> - Ensure immutability of audit data.
> - Determine a strategy to filter or obfuscate sensitive data in your workspace.
> - Purge sensitive data that was accidentally collected.
> - Link your workspace to a dedicated cluster for enhanced security features, including double encryption using customer managed keys and customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure to approve or reject Microsoft data access requests.

### Configuration recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|:---|:---|
| Configure access for different types of data in the workspace required for different roles in your organization. | Set the [access control mode](../logs/manage-access.md#access-control-mode) for the workspace to *Use resource or workspace permissions* to allow resource owners to use [resource-context](../logs/manage-access.md#access-mode) to access their data without being granted explicit access to the workspace. This simplifies your workspace configuration and helps to ensure users aren't able to access data they shouldn't.<br><br>Assign the appropriate [built-in role](../logs/manage-access.md#azure-rbac) to grant workspace permissions to administrators at either the subscription, resource group, or workspace level depending on their scope of responsibilities.<br><br>Apply [table level RBAC](../logs/manage-access.md#set-table-level-read-access) for users who require access to a set of tables across multiple resources. Users with table permissions have access to all the data in the table regardless of their resource permissions.<br><br>See [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](../logs/manage-access.md) for details on the different options for granting access to data in the workspace. |
| Use Azure private link to remove access to your workspace from public networks. | Connections to public endpoints are secured with end-to-end encryption. If you require a private endpoint, you can use [Azure private link](../logs/private-link-security.md) to allow resources to connect to your Log Analytics workspace through authorized private networks. Private link can also be used to force workspace data ingestion through ExpressRoute or a VPN. See [Design your Azure Private Link setup](../logs/private-link-design.md) to determine the best network and DNS topology for your environment. |
| Configure log query auditing to track which users are running queries. | [Log query auditing](../logs/query-audit.md) records the details for each query that's run in a workspace. Treat this audit data as security data and secure the [LAQueryLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/laquerylogs) table appropriately. Configure the audit logs for each workspace to be sent to the local workspace, or consolidate in a dedicated security workspace if you separate your operational and security data. Use [Log Analytics workspace insights](../logs/log-analytics-workspace-insights-overview.md) to periodically review this data and consider creating log search alert rules to proactively notify you if unauthorized users are attempting to run queries. |
| Ensure immutability of audit data. | Azure Monitor is an append-only data platform, but includes provisions to delete data for compliance purposes. You can [set a lock on your Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources) to block all activities that could delete data: purge, table delete, and table- or workspace-level data retention changes. However, this lock can still be removed.<br><br>If you need a fully tamper-proof solution, we recommend you [export your data to an immutable storage solution](/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-storage-overview). Use [data export](../logs/logs-data-export.md) to send data to an Azure storage account with [immutability policies](/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-policy-configure-version-scope) to protect against data tampering. Not every type of logs has the same relevance for compliance, auditing, or security, so determine the specific data types that should be exported. |
| Determine a strategy to filter or obfuscate sensitive data in your workspace. | You might be collecting data that includes [sensitive information](../logs/personal-data-mgmt.md). Filter records that shouldn't be collected using the configuration for the particular data source. Use a [transformation](../essentials/data-collection-transformations.md) if only particular columns in the data should be removed or obfuscated.<br><br>If you have standards that require the original data to be unmodified, then you can use the ['h' literal](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string#obfuscated-string-literals) in KQL queries to obfuscate query results displayed in workbooks. |
| Purge sensitive data that was accidentally collected. | Check periodically for private data that might accidentally be collected in your workspace and use [data purge](../logs/personal-data-mgmt.md#exporting-and-deleting-personal-data) to remove it. Data in tables with the [Auxiliary plan](../logs/data-platform-logs.md#table-plans) can't currently be purged.|
| Link your workspace to a dedicated cluster for enhanced security features, including double encryption using customer managed keys and customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure to approve or reject Microsoft data access requests.| Azure Monitor encrypts all data at rest and saved queries using Microsoft-managed keys (MMK). If you collect enough data for a [dedicated cluster](../logs/logs-dedicated-clusters.md), use:<br><br>- [Customer-managed keys](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md) for greater flexibility and key lifecycle control. If you use Microsoft Sentinel, then make sure that you're familiar with the considerations at [Set up Microsoft Sentinel customer-managed key](/azure/sentinel/customer-managed-keys#considerations).<br><br>- [Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure](/azure/security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview) to review and approve or reject customer data access requests. Customer Lockbox is used when a Microsoft engineer needs to access customer data, whether in response to a customer-initiated support ticket or a problem identified by Microsoft. Lockbox can't currently be applied to tables with the [Auxiliary plan](../logs/data-platform-logs.md#table-plans).  |
