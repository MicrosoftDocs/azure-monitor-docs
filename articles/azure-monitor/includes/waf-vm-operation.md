### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Migrate from legacy agents to Azure Monitor agent.
> - Use Azure Arc to monitor your VMs outside of Azure.
> - Use Azure Policy to deploy agents and assign data collection rules.
> - Establish a strategy for structure of data collection rules.
> - Consider migrating System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) client management packs to Azure Monitor.


### Configuration recommendations

| Recommendation | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Migrate from legacy agents to Azure Monitor agent. | The Azure Monitor agent is simpler to manage than the legacy Log Analytics agent and allows more flexibility in your [Log Analytics workspace design](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design). Both the Windows and Linux agents allow multihoming, which means they can connect to multiple workspaces. Data collection rules allow you to manage your data collection settings at scale and define unique, scoped configurations for subsets of machines. See [Migrate to Azure Monitor Agent from Log Analytics agent](../agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration.md) for considerations and migration methods. | 
| Use Azure Arc to monitor your VMs outside of Azure. | [Azure Arc for servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview) allows you to manage physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network, or other cloud provider. With the [Azure Connected machine agent](/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview) in place, you can deploy the Azure Monitor agent to these VMs using the same method that you do for your Azure VMs and then monitor your entire collection of VMs using the same Azure Monitor tools. |
| Use Azure Policy to deploy agents and assign data collection rules. | [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) allows you to have agents automatically deployed to sets of existing VMs and any new VMs that are created. This ensures that all VMs are monitored with minimal intervention by administrators. If you use VM insights, see [Enable VM insights by using Azure Policy](../vm/vminsights-enable-policy.md). If you want to manage Azure Monitor agent without VM insights, see [Enable Azure Monitor Agent using Azure Policy](../agents/azure-monitor-agent-policy.md). See [Manually create a DCR](../essentials/data-collection-rule-create-edit.md?tabs=arm#create-a-dcr) for a template to create a data collection rule association. |
| Establish a strategy for structure of data collection rules. | Data collection rules define data to collect from virtual machines with the Azure Monitor agent and where to send that data. Each DCR can include multiple collection scenarios and be associated with any number of VMs. [Establish a strategy for configuring DCRs](../essentials/data-collection-rule-best-practices.md) to collect only required data for different groups of VMs while minimizing the number of DCRs that you need to manage. |
| Consider migrating SCOM client management packs to Azure Monitor. | If you have an existing SCOM environment for monitoring client workloads, you may be able to migrate enough of the management pack logic to Azure Monitor to allow you to retire your SCOM environment, or at least to retire certain management packs. See [Migrate from System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) to Azure Monitor](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-management-packs.md#migrate-management-pack-logic-for-vm-workloads). |
