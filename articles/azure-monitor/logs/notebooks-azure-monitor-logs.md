# Tutorial: Analyze data in Azure Monitor Logs using a notebook

Notebooks are integrated environments that let you create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Integrating a notebook with a Log Analytics workspace lets you create a multi-step process that runs code in each step based on the results of the previous step. You can use such streamlined processes to build machine learning pipelines, advanced analysis tools, troubleshooting guides (TSGs) for support needs, and more.

Integrating a notebook with a Log Analytics workspace also lets you:

* Run KQL queries and custom code in any language.
* Introduce new analytics and visualization capabilities, such as new machine learning models, custom timelines, and process trees.
* Integrate data sets outside of Azure Monitor Logs, such as an on-premises data sets.
* Take advantage of increased service limits using the Query API limits compared to the Azure portal.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Integrate a notebook with your Log Analytics workspace using the [Azure Monitor Query client library](/python/api/overview/azure/monitor-query-readme) and the [Azure Identity client library](https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/) 
> * Explore and visualize data from your Log Analytics workspace in a notebook
> * Ingest data from your notebook into a custom table in your Log Analytics workspace (optional) 

For an example of how to build a machine learning pipeline to analyze data in Azure Monitor Logs using a notebook, see this [sample notebook: Detect anomalies in Azure Monitor Logs using machine learning techniques](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/monitor/azure-monitor-query/samples/notebooks/sample_machine_learning_sklearn.ipynb).

> [!TIP]
> To work around [API-related limitations](/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#la-query-api), [split larger queries into multiple smaller queries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/monitor/azure-monitor-query/samples/notebooks/sample_large_query.ipynb).

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you need:

* An [Azure Machine Learning workspace with a CPU compute instance](/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources) with:

    * [A notebook](/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-run-notebooks#start-with-notebooks). 
    * A kernel set to Python 3.8 or higher.

* The following roles and permissions: 

    * In **Azure Monitor Logs**: The **Logs Analytics Contributor** role to read data from and send data to your Logs Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](../logs/manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor).
    * In **Azure Machine Learning**:
        * A resource group-level **Owner** or **Contributor** role, to create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace if needed.
        * A **Contributor** role on the Azure Machine Learning workspace where you run your notebook.

        For more information, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-assign-roles).

## 1. Integrate your Log Analytics workspace with your notebook 

Set up your notebook to query your Log Analytics workspace:

1. Install the Azure Monitor Query, Azure Identity and Azure Monitor Ingestion client libraries along with the Pandas data analysis library, Plotly visualization library:

    ```python
    import sys
    
    !{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade azure-monitor-query azure-identity azure-monitor-ingestion
    
    !{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade pandas plotly
    ```

1. Set the `LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID` variable below to the ID of your Log Analytics workspace. The variable is currently set to use the [Azure Monitor Demo workspace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade), which you can use to demo the notebook.

    ```python
    LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID = "DEMO_WORKSPACE"
    ```
    
1. Set up `LogsQueryClient` to authenticate and query Azure Monitor Logs. 

    This code sets up `LogsQueryClient` to authenticate using `DefaultAzureCredential`:
    
    ```python
    from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
    from azure.core.pipeline.policies import AzureKeyCredentialPolicy
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryClient
    
    if LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID == "DEMO_WORKSPACE":
        credential = AzureKeyCredential("DEMO_KEY")
        authentication_policy = AzureKeyCredentialPolicy(name="X-Api-Key", credential=credential)
    else:
        credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
        authentication_policy = None
        
    logs_query_client = LogsQueryClient(credential, authentication_policy=authentication_policy)
    ```

    `LogsQueryClient` typically only supports authentication with Microsoft Entra token credentials. However, we can pass a custom authentication policy to enable the use of API keys. This allows the client to [query the demo workspace](../logs/api/access-api.md#authenticate-with-a-demo-api-key). The availability and access to this demo workspace is subject to change, so we recommend using your own Log Analytics workspace.

1. Define a helper function, called `query_logs_workspace`, to run a given query in the Log Analytics workspace and return the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px
    
    from azure.monitor.query import LogsQueryStatus
    from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError
    
    
    def query_logs_workspace(query):
        try:
            response = logs_query_client.query_workspace(LOGS_WORKSPACE_ID, query, timespan=None)
            if response.status == LogsQueryStatus.PARTIAL:
                error = response.partial_error
                data = response.partial_data
                print(error.message)
            elif response.status == LogsQueryStatus.SUCCESS:
                data = response.tables
            for table in data:
                my_data = pd.DataFrame(data=table.rows, columns=table.columns)
        except HttpResponseError as err:
            print("something fatal happened")
            print (err)
        return my_data
    ```

## 2. Explore and visualize data from your Log Analytics workspace in your notebook

Let's look at some data in the workspace by running a query from the notebook:

1. This query checks how much data (in Megabytes) you ingested into each of the tables (data types) in your Log Analytics workspace each hour over the past week:

    ```python
    TABLE = "Usage"
    
    QUERY = f"""
    let starttime = 7d; // Start date for the time series, counting back from the current date
    let endtime = 0d; // today 
    {TABLE} | project TimeGenerated, DataType, Quantity 
    | where TimeGenerated between (ago(starttime)..ago(endtime))
    | summarize ActualUsage=sum(Quantity) by TimeGenerated=bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), DataType
    """
    
    df = query_logs_workspace(QUERY)
    display(df)
    ```

    The resulting DataFrame shows the hourly ingestion in each of the tables in the Log Analytics workspace:
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/jupyter-notebook-ml-azure-monitor-logs/machine-learning-azure-monitor-logs-ingestion-all-tables-dataframe.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a DataFrame generated in a notebook with log ingestion data retrieved from a Log Analytics workspace."

1. Now, let's view the data as a graph that shows hourly usage for various data types over time, based on the Pandas DataFrame:

    ```python
    df = df.sort_values(by="TimeGenerated")
    graph = px.line(df, x='TimeGenerated', y="ActualUsage", color='DataType', title="Usage in the last week - All data types")
    graph.show()
    ```

    The resulting graph looks like this:

    :::image type="content" source="media/jupyter-notebook-ml-azure-monitor-logs/machine-learning-azure-monitor-logs-ingestion-all-tables.png" lightbox="media/jupyter-notebook-ml-azure-monitor-logs/machine-learning-azure-monitor-logs-ingestion-all-tables.png" alt-text="A graph that shows the amount of data ingested into each of the tables in a Log Analytics workspace over seven days.":::

    You've successfully queried and visualized log data from your Log Analytics workspace in your notebook.

## 3. Analyze data

As a simple example, let's take the first five rows:

```
analyzed_df = df.head(5)
```

For an example of how to implement machine learning techniques to analyze data in Azure Monitor Logs, see this [sample notebook: Detect anomalies in Azure Monitor Logs using machine learning techniques](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/monitor/azure-monitor-query/samples/notebooks/sample_machine_learning_sklearn.ipynb).

## 4. Ingest analyzed data into a custom table in your Log Analytics workspace (optional)

Send your analysis results to a custom table in your Log Analytics workspace to trigger alerts or to make them available for further analysis.

1. To send data to your Log Analytics workspace, you need a custom table, data collection endpoint, data collection rule, and a registered Microsoft Entra application with permission to use the data collection rule, as explained in [Tutorial: Send data to Azure Monitor Logs with Logs ingestion API (Azure portal)](../logs/tutorial-logs-ingestion-portal.md).

    When you create your custom table:

    1. Upload this sample file to define the table schema:
    
        ```json
        [
          {
            "TimeGenerated": "2023-03-19T19:56:43.7447391Z",
            "ActualUsage": 40.1,
            "DataType": "AzureDiagnostics"
          }
        ]
        ```
 
1. Define the constants you need for the Logs Ingestion API:

    ```python
    os.environ['AZURE_TENANT_ID'] = "<Tenant ID>"; #ID of the tenant where the data collection endpoint resides
    os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'] = "<Application ID>"; #Application ID to which you granted permissions to your data collection rule
    os.environ['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'] = "<Client secret>"; #Secret created for the application
    
    
    
    os.environ['LOGS_DCR_STREAM_NAME'] = "<Custom stream name>" ##Name of the custom stream from the data collection rule
    os.environ['LOGS_DCR_RULE_ID'] = "<Data collection rule immutableId>" # immutableId of your data collection rule
    os.environ['DATA_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT'] = "<Logs ingestion URL of your endpoint>" # URL that looks like this: https://xxxx.ingest.monitor.azure.com
    ```
1. Ingest the data into the custom table in your Log Analytics workspace:

    ```python
    from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError
    from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
    from azure.monitor.ingestion import LogsIngestionClient
    import json
    
    
    credential = ClientSecretCredential(
        tenant_id=AZURE_TENANT_ID,
        client_id=AZURE_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret=AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
    )
    
    client = LogsIngestionClient(endpoint=DATA_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT, credential=credential, logging_enable=True)
    
    body = json.loads(analyzed_df.to_json(orient='records', date_format='iso'))
    
    try:
       response = client.upload(rule_id=LOGS_DCR_RULE_ID, stream_name=LOGS_DCR_STREAM_NAME, logs=body)
       print("Upload request accepted")
    except HttpResponseError as e:
        print(f"Upload failed: {e}")
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create a table in your Log Analytics workspace, it can take up to 15 minutes for ingested data to appear in the table.

1. Verify that the data now appears in your custom table.
