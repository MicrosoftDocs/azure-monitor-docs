# Customer intent: As a Log Analytics workspace administrator, I want to create a custom table with the Auxiliary table plan, so that I can ingest and retain data at a low cost for auditing and compliance.

# Delete data ingested to a Log Analytics workspace (Preview) 


- **Delete incorrect data ingestion** - service team can execute Delete data Geneva action to remove "florin" data from workspace, where Activity log event is sent to customer's subscription with notification and reference to support for more information.
- **Remove privacy data** - customer realized that sensitive or privacy data was ingested to the workspace, and can use Delete data API to remove it.
- **Remove corrupted data** - customer realized that corrupted data was ingested and skew query results, and can use Delete data API to remove it.

## Permissions

## Prerequisites

## Limitations

â€¢	User can submit 10 Delete data request per hour. The delete requests are queued and execution depends on cluster and table business. When available, operation is fast, and performed as Analytics queries.

## Call the delete data API to delete data from a specific table

Users can request to delete data in a table using a list of columns, operators, and values as query filter -  Supported operators are ==, =~, in, in~, >, >=, <, <=, between, and have the same behavior as they would in a KQL query. For example:

```json 
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourcegroup}/providers/Microsoft.
OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspace}/tables/{table}/deleteData?api-version=2023-09-01
Authorization: {{credential}}
 
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "column": "TimeGenerated",
      "operator": "<",
      "value": "2024-09-23T00:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Check delete data operation status 

Operations are executed asynchronously. To check the status of operation:
 
 ```json 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.
OperationalInsights/locations/{region}/operationstatuses/{responseOperation}?api-version=2023-09-01
Authorization: {{credential}}
```
