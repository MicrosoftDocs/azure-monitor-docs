# Configure granular RBAC (Preview) in Azure Monitor

Granular role-based access control (RBAC) is a feature of Azure Monitor Log Analytics that implements fine-grained data access control. 

Learn how to control access to logs based on roles, departments, and geographical locations. This includes scenarios like restricting HR personnel to employee data or limiting access to logs by country or department. 

In this example scenario, well-known Log Analytics tables and fields are used to enforce row-level access. Data is segregated based on attributes like device type and user principal name (UPN).

For more information about granular RBAC concepts, see [Granular role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure Monitor](granular-rbac-log-analytics.md).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to complete this scenario:

- Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace with tables
- A role assigned to your account giving permission to configure custom roles and assign them to users or groups with conditions like the [Role Based Access Control Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/#role-based-access-control-administrator) or [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#user-access-administrator).

## Define the scenario

In this scenario, row-level access control is implemented in a restrictive manner with the `CommonSecurityLog` and a permissive manner to control the `SigninLogs` and `DnsEvents` tables in a Logs Analytics workspace. Conditions are set for a group of operators as follows:

1. Set the network team's group access to only access the `CommonSecurityLog` table where the DeviceVendor name matches the network firewalls. This configuration uses the *No access to data, except what is allowed* strategy.
1. Give the tier 1 security analyst team access to all tables, but restrict the `SigninLogs` and `DnsEvents` tables to prevent them from accessing records containing the UPN or computername of the CEO. This configuration uses the *Access to all data, except what isn't allowed* strategy.

## Create custom roles

Set up custom roles for the defined scenario. Create one for the network team and another for the security team. Keep in mind, role assignments are additive, so remove any roles that assign read access giving more privileges than the granular RBAC conditions. For more information, see [Configure granular RBAC role creation](granular-rbac-log-analytics.md#role-creation).

1. From the resource group containing the prerequisite Log Analytics workspace, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Select **Add custom role**.
1. Create the general data access role with the following actions and data action at the resource group level:

| Custom role definition | Detail |
|---|---|
| Actions | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read`</br>`Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read` |
| Data actions | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/data/read` |

This image shows how the custom role actions and data actions appear in the **Add custom role** page.

4. Enter a name for the custom role, such as `Log Analytics Network Device team`
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the `Log Analytics Security Analysts tier 1` custom role. Use the **Clone a role** option and choose the `Log Analytics Network Device team` role as a base.

## Assign custom roles

Assign the custom roles to a user or group. For more information, see [Assign granular RBAC roles](granular-rbac-log-analytics.md#conditions-and-expressions). 

1. From the Log Analytics workspace, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Select **Add role assignment**.
1. Select the `Log Analytics Network Device team` custom role you created, then select **Next**.
1. Select the user or group you want to assign the role to, then select **Next**. This example assigns the role to the network team security group.
1. Select **Conditions** > **Add condition** > **Add action**.
1. Choose the **Read workspace data** data action > **Select**.

Here's how the action portion looks when completed:

:::image type="content" source="media/configure-granular-rbac/add-action.png" lightbox="media/configure-granular-rbac/add-action.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the add action part of the add conditions page.":::

## Build restrictive condition

The first custom role uses the *No access to data, except what is allowed* strategy. In this use case, the network team only needs access to the `CommonSecurityLog` table, and only for records where the DeviceVendor matches their firewall solutions, either `Check Point` or `SonicWall`.

1. In the **Build expression** section, select **Add expression**.
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Table Name* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Select *StringEquals* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. Type `CommonSecurityLog` in the **Value** field.
1. Select **Add expression**, then select **And** to add another expression.
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Column value* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Enter `DeviceVendor` for the **Key**. 
1. Select *ForAnyOfAnyValues:StringLikeIgnoreCase* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. In the **Value** fields, enter `Check Point` and `SonicWall`.
1. Select expression **1** and **2** > select **Group** with the **And** radio button selected.
1. Select **Save**.

Here's how the restrictive condition looks when completed:

:::image type="content" source="media/configure-granular-rbac/no-access-to-data-except-allowed-condition.png" lightbox="media/configure-granular-rbac/no-access-to-data-except-allowed-condition.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the expressions for the restrictive condition.":::

Here's how the restrictive condition looks in code form:
```
(
 (
  !(ActionMatches{'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/data/read'})
 )
 OR 
(
  (
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables:name] StringEquals 'CommonSecurityLog'
   AND
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/record:DeviceVendor<$key_case_sensitive$>] ForAnyOfAnyValues:StringLikeIgnoreCase {'Check Point', 'SonicWall'}
  )
 )
)
```

Allow up to 15 minutes for effective permissions to take effect.

## Build permissive condition

The second custom role uses the *Access to all data, except what isn't allowed* strategy. In this use case, the tier 1 security analyst team needs access to all tables, but restricts access to the `SigninLogs` and `DnsEvents` tables to prevent accessing records for the UPN or computername of the CEO.

1. Add a new role assignment, then create the permissive expression. From the Log Analytics workspace, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Select **Add role assignment**.
1. Select the `Log Analytics Security Analysts tier 1` custom role you created, then select **Next**.
1. Select the user or group you want to assign the role to, then select **Next**. This example assigns the role to the tier 1 analysts security group.
1. Select **Conditions** > **Add condition** > **Add action**.
1. Choose the **Read workspace data** data action > **Select**.

**Expression 1**
1. In the **Build expression** section, select **Add expression**
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Table Name* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Select *ForAnyOfAllValues:StringNotEquals* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. Type `SigninLogs` and `DnsEvents` in the **Value** fields.
1. Ensure the **Or** operator is selected after expression 1. 

**Expression 2**
1. Select **Add expression**
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Table Name* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Select *StringEquals* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. In the **Value** field, enter `SigninLogs`.

**Expression 3**
1. Select **Add expression**
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Column value* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Enter `UserPrincipalName` for the **Key**.
1. Select *StringNotEquals* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. Type `CEO@contoso.com` in the **Value** field.
1. Select expression **2** and **3** > select **Group** with the **And** radio button selected.

**Expression 4**
1. Select **Add expression**
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Table Name* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Select *StringEquals* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. In the **Value** field, enter `DnsEvents`.

**Expression 5** - The limit in the visual editor is five, but more expressions can be added in the code editor.
1. Select **Add expression**
1. Select *Resource* from the **Attribute source** dropdown.
1. Select *Column value* from the **Attribute** dropdown.
1. Enter `ComputerName` for the **Key**.
1. Select *StringNotEquals* from the **Operator** dropdown.
1. Type `CEOlaptop` in the **Value** field.
1. Select expression **4** and **5** > select **Group** with the **And** radio button selected.
1. Select **Save**.

Here's how the permissive condition looks when completed - notice the **Add expression** button is disabled. This behavior is due to the maximum number of expressions reached.

Here's how the permissive condition looks in code form:
```
(
   (
   !(ActionMatches{'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/data/read'})
   )
   OR 
   (
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables:name] ForAnyOfAllValues:StringNotEquals {'SigninLogs', 'DnsEvents'}
   OR
   (
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables:name] StringEquals 'SigninLogs'
   AND
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/record:UserPrincipalName<$key_case_sensitive$>] StringNotEquals 'CEO@contoso.com'
   )
   OR
   (
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables:name] StringEquals 'DnsEvents'
   AND
   @Resource[Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/record:Computer<$key_case_sensitive$>] StringNotEquals 'CEOlaptop1'
   )
   )
)
```
Allow up to 15 minutes for effective permissions to take effect.

## Troubleshoot and monitor

For general ABAC troubleshooting, see [Troubleshoot Azure role assignment conditions](/azure/role-based-access-control/conditions-troubleshoot).

- Changes to role assignments are logged in Azure Activity logs.
- LAQueryLogs table records whether user queries executed with an applicable ABAC condition in the `ConditionalDataAccess` column. For more information, see [LAQueryLogs table reference](../reference/tables/laquerylogs.md). 
   
   Here's an example of an audited query run by a tier 1 security analyst that triggered the condition configured for the `SigninLogs` table:
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/configure-granular-rbac/conditional-data-access-troubleshooting.png" lightbox="media/configure-granular-rbac/conditional-data-access-troubleshooting.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows condition applied for an audited query.":::

- The values used for table names and column values are case-sensitive. If a table name or value is incorrectly specified, the condition may fail, or yield unexpected behavior, and access to the requested data might be denied.
- Invalid conditions that cause a logic error trigger a "400 Bad Request" error message for all affected users. The administrator must revise the condition. An example is setting a condition on a workspace level with a column that doesn't exist in any tables.
