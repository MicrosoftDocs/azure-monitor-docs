# Create and manage a dedicated cluster in Azure Monitor Logs 

Linking a Log Analytics workspace to a dedicated cluster in Azure Monitor provides advanced capabilities and higher query utilization. Clusters require a minimum ingestion commitment of 100 GB per day. You can link and unlink workspaces from a dedicated cluster without any data loss or service interruption. 

## Advanced capabilities
Capabilities that require dedicated clusters:

- **[Customer-managed keys](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md)** - Encrypt cluster data using keys that you provide and control.
- **[Lockbox](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md#customer-lockbox)** - Control Microsoft support engineer access requests to your data.
- **[Double encryption](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption#doubly-encrypt-data-with-infrastructure-encryption)** - Protect against a scenario where one of the encryption algorithms or keys may be compromised. In this case, the extra layer of encryption continues to protect your data.
- **[Cross-query optimization](../logs/cross-workspace-query.md)** - Cross-workspace queries run faster when workspaces are on the same cluster.
- **Cost optimization** - Link your workspaces in same region to cluster to get commitment tier discount to all workspaces, even to ones with low ingestion that 
eligible for commitment tier discount.
- **[Availability zones](/azure/availability-zones/az-overview)** - Protect your data from datacenter failures by relying on datacenters in different physical locations, equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. The physical separation in zones and independent infrastructure makes an incident far less likely since the workspace can rely on the resources from any of the zones. [Azure Monitor availability zones](./availability-zones.md#supported-regions) covers broader parts of the service and when available in your region, extends your Azure Monitor resilience automatically. Azure Monitor creates dedicated clusters as availability-zone-enabled (`isAvailabilityZonesEnabled`: 'true') by default in supported regions. [Dedicated clusters Availability zones](./availability-zones.md#supported-regions) aren't supported in all regions currently.
- **[Ingest from Azure Event Hubs](../logs/ingest-logs-event-hub.md)** - Lets you ingest data directly from an event hub into a Log Analytics workspace. Dedicated cluster lets you use capability when ingestion from all linked workspaces combined meet commitment tier. 

## Cluster pricing model
Log Analytics Dedicated Clusters use a commitment tier pricing model of at least 100 GB/day. Any usage above the tier level incurs charges based on the per-GB rate of that commitment tier. See [Azure Monitor Logs pricing details](cost-logs.md#dedicated-clusters) for pricing details for dedicated clusters. The commitment tiers have a 31-day commitment period from the time a commitment tier is selected.

## Prerequisites

- Dedicated clusters require a minimum ingestion commitment of 100 GB per day.
- When creating a dedicated cluster, you can't name it with the same name as a cluster that was deleted within the past two weeks.

## Required permissions

To perform cluster-related actions, you need these permissions:

| Action | Permissions or role needed |
|-|-|
| Create a dedicated cluster |`Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*`and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example | 
| Change cluster properties |`Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example | 
| Link workspaces to a cluster | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write`, `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write`, and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/linkedservices/write` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example | 
| Check workspace link status | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read` permissions to the workspace, as provided by the [Log Analytics Reader built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-reader), for example |
| Get clusters or check a cluster's provisioning status | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/read` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Reader built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-reader), for example | 
| Update commitment tier or billingType in a cluster | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example |
| Grant the required permissions | Owner or Contributor role that has `*/write` permissions, or the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), which has `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/*` permissions | 
| Unlink a workspace from cluster | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/linkedServices/delete` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example |
| Delete a dedicated cluster | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/delete` permissions, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example |

For more information on Log Analytics permissions, see [Manage access to log data and workspaces in Azure Monitor](./manage-access.md). 

## Resource Manager template samples

This article includes sample [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/syntax) to create and configure Log Analytics clusters in Azure Monitor. Each sample includes a template file and a parameters file with sample values to provide to the template.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-samples](../../../includes/azure-monitor-resource-manager-samples.md)]

### Template references

- [Microsoft.OperationalInsights clusters](/azure/templates/microsoft.operationalinsights/2020-03-01-preview/clusters)

## Create a dedicated cluster

Provide the following properties when creating new dedicated cluster:

- **ClusterName**: Must be unique for the resource group.
- **ResourceGroupName**: Use a central IT resource group because many teams in the organization usually share clusters. For more design considerations, review [Design a Log Analytics workspace configuration](../logs/workspace-design.md).
- **Location**
- **SkuCapacity**: You can set the commitment tier to 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000 GB per day. The minimum commitment tier supported in CLI is 500 currently. Use REST to configure lower commitment tiers with minimum of 100. For more information on cluster costs, see [Dedicate clusters](./cost-logs.md#dedicated-clusters). 
- **Managed identity**: Clusters support two [managed identity types](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#managed-identity-types): 
  - System-assigned managed identity - Generated automatically with the cluster creation when identity `type` is set to "*SystemAssigned*". This identity can be used later to grant storage access to your Key Vault for wrap and unwrap operations.

    *Identity in Cluster's REST Call*
    ```json
    {
      "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned"
        }
    }
    ```
  - User-assigned managed identity - Lets you configure a customer-managed key at cluster creation, when granting it permissions in your Key Vault before cluster creation.

    *Identity in Cluster's REST Call*
    ```json
    {
    "identity": {
      "type": "UserAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
          "subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/UserAssignedIdentities/<cluster-assigned-managed-identity>"
        }
      }  
    }
    ```

After you create your cluster resource, you can edit properties such as *sku*, *keyVaultProperties, or *billingType*. See more details below.

Deleted clusters take two weeks to be completely removed. You can have up to seven clusters per subscription and region, five active, and two deleted in past two weeks.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating a cluster involves multiple resources and operation typically complete in two hours.
> Dedicated cluster is billed once provisioned regardless data ingestion and it's recommended to prepare the deployment to expedite the provisioning and workspaces link to cluster. Verify the following:
> - A list of initial workspace to be linked to cluster is identified
> - You have permissions to subscription intended for the cluster and any workspace to be linked

### Check cluster provisioning status

The provisioning of the Log Analytics cluster takes a while to complete. Use one of the following methods to check the *ProvisioningState* property. The value is *ProvisioningAccount* while provisioning and *Succeeded* when completed.

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

The portal will provide a status as the cluster is being provisioned.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics cluster show --resource-group "resource-group-name" --name "cluster-name"
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

Get-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name"
```
 
#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Send a GET request on the cluster resource and look at the *provisioningState* value. The value is *ProvisioningAccount* while provisioning and *Succeeded* when completed.

  ```rest
  GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subscription-id/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/cluster-name?api-version=2022-10-01
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

  **Response**

  ```json
  {
    "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned",
      "tenantId": "tenant-id",
      "principalId": "principal-id"
    },
    "sku": {
      "name": "capacityreservation",
      "capacity": 100
    },
    "properties": {
      "provisioningState": "ProvisioningAccount",
      "clusterId": "cluster-id",
      "billingType": "Cluster",
      "lastModifiedDate": "last-modified-date",
      "createdDate": "created-date",
      "isDoubleEncryptionEnabled": false,
      "isAvailabilityZonesEnabled": false,
      "capacityReservationProperties": {
        "lastSkuUpdate": "last-sku-modified-date",
        "minCapacity": 100
      }
    },
    "id": "/subscriptions/subscription-id/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/cluster-name",
    "name": "cluster-name",
    "type": "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters",
    "location": "cluster-region"
  }
  ```

The managed identity service generates the *principalId* GUID when you create the cluster.

## Link a workspace to a cluster

> [!NOTE]
> - Linking a workspace can be performed only after the completion of the Log Analytics cluster provisioning.
> - Linking a workspace to a cluster involves syncing multiple backend components and cache hydration, which typically complete in two hours.
> - When linking a Log Analytics workspace workspace, the workspace billing plan in changed to *LACluster*, and you should remove SKU in workspace template to prevent conflict during workspace deployment.
> - Other than the billing aspects that is governed by the cluster plan, all workspace configurations and query aspects remain unchanged during and after the link.

You need 'write' permissions to both the workspace and the cluster resource for workspace link operation:

- In the workspace: *Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write*
- In the cluster resource: *Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write*

Once Log Analytics workspace linked to a dedicated cluster, new data sent to workspace is ingested to your dedicated cluster, while previously ingested data remains in Log Analytics cluster. Linking a workspace has no effect on workspace operation, including ingestion and query experiences. Log Analytics query engine stitches data from old and new clusters automatically, and the results of queries are complete. 

Clusters are regional and can be linked to up to 1,000 workspaces located in the same region as the cluster. A workspace can't be linked to a cluster more than twice a month, to prevent data fragmentation.

Linked workspaces can be in different subscriptions than the subscription the cluster is located in. The workspace and cluster can be in different tenants if Azure Lighthouse is used to map both of them to a single tenant.

When a dedicated cluster is configured with a customer-managed key (CMK), the newly ingested data is encrypted with your key, while older data remains encrypted with a Microsoft-managed key (MMK). The key configuration is abstracted by Log Analytics and the query across old and new data encryptions is performed seamlessly.

Use the following steps to link a workspace to a cluster. You can use automation for linking multiple workspaces:

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Select your cluster from **Log Analytics dedicated clusters** menu in the Azure portal and then click **Linked workspaces** to view all workspaces currently linked to the dedicated cluster. Click **Link workspaces** to link additional workspaces.

:::image type="content" source="./media/logs-dedicated-cluster/linked-workspaces.png" alt-text="Screenshot for linking workspaces to a dedicated cluster in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/logs-dedicated-cluster/linked-workspaces.png":::

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

> [!NOTE]
> Use **cluster** value for linked-service ```name```.

```azurecli
# Find cluster resource ID
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"
$clusterResourceId = az monitor log-analytics cluster list --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "[?contains(name, 'cluster-name')].[id]" --output tsv

# Link workspace
az account set --subscription "workspace-subscription-id"
az monitor log-analytics workspace linked-service create --no-wait --name cluster --resource-group "resource-group-name" --workspace-name "workspace-name" --write-access-resource-id $clusterResourceId

# Wait for job completion when `--no-wait` was used
$workspaceResourceId = az monitor log-analytics workspace list --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "[?contains(name, 'workspace-name')].[id]" --output tsv
az resource wait --deleted --ids $workspaceResourceId --include-response-body true
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

> [!NOTE]
> Use **cluster** value for ```LinkedServiceName```.

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

# Find cluster resource ID
$clusterResourceId = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name").id

Select-AzSubscription "workspace-subscription-id"

# Link the workspace to the cluster
Set-AzOperationalInsightsLinkedService -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -WorkspaceName "workspace-name" -LinkedServiceName cluster -WriteAccessResourceId $clusterResourceId -AsJob

# Check when the job is done
Get-Job -Command "Set-AzOperationalInsightsLinkedService" | Format-List -Property *
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Use the following REST call to link to a cluster:

*Send*

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/<workspace-name>/linkedservices/cluster?api-version=2020-08-01

{
  "properties": {
    "WriteAccessResourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/clusters/<cluster-name>"
    }
}
```

*Response*

202 (Accepted) and header.

### Check workspace link status

The workspace link operation can take up to 90 minutes to complete. You can check the status on both the linked workspaces and the cluster. When completed, the workspace resources will include `clusterResourceId` property under `features`, and the cluster will include linked workspaces under `associatedWorkspaces` section.

When a cluster is configured with a customer managed key, data ingested to the workspaces after the link operation is complete will be stored encrypted with your key.

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

On the **Overview** page for your dedicated cluster, select **JSON View**. The `associatedWorkspaces` section lists the workspaces linked to the cluster.

## Change cluster properties

After you create your cluster resource and it's fully provisioned, you can edit cluster properties using CLI, PowerShell or REST API. Properties you can set after the cluster is provisioned include:

- **keyVaultProperties** - Contains the key in Azure Key Vault with the following parameters: *KeyVaultUri*, *KeyName*, *KeyVersion*. See [Update cluster with Key identifier details](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md#update-cluster-with-key-identifier-details).
- **Identity** - The identity used to authenticate to your Key Vault. This can be System-assigned or User-assigned.
- **billingType** - Billing attribution for the cluster resource and its data. Includes on the following values:
  - **Cluster (default)** - The costs for your cluster are attributed to the cluster resource.
  - **Workspaces** - The costs for your cluster are attributed proportionately to the workspaces in the Cluster, with the cluster resource being billed some of the usage if the total ingested data for the day is under the commitment tier. See [Log Analytics Dedicated Clusters](./cost-logs.md#dedicated-clusters) to learn more about the cluster pricing model.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Cluster update should not include both identity and key identifier details in the same operation. If you need to update both, the update should be in two consecutive operations.

## Update commitment tier in cluster

When the data volume to linked workspaces changes over time, you can update the Commitment Tier level appropriately to optimize cost. The tier is specified in units of Gigabytes (GB) and can have values of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000 GB per day. You don't have to provide the full REST request body, but you must include the sku.

During the commitment period, you can change to a higher commitment tier, which restarts the 31-day commitment period. You can't move back to pay-as-you-go or to a lower commitment tier until after you finish the commitment period.

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Select your cluster from **Log Analytics dedicated clusters** menu in the Azure portal and then click **Change** next to **Commitment tier**

### Unlink a workspace from cluster

You can unlink a workspace from a cluster at any time. The workspace pricing tier is changed to per-GB, data ingested to cluster before the unlink operation remains in the cluster, and new data to workspace get ingested to Log Analytics.

> [!WARNING]
> Unlinking a workspace does not move workspace data out of the cluster. Any data collected for workspace while linked to cluster, remains in cluster for the retention period defined in workspace, and accessible as long as cluster isn't deleted.

Queries aren't affected when workspace is unlinked and service performs cross-cluster queries seamlessly. If cluster was configured with Customer-managed key (CMK), data ingested to workspace while was linked, remains encrypted with your key and accessible, while your key and permissions to Key Vault remain.

> [!NOTE] 
> - There is a limit of two link operations for a specific workspace within a month to prevent data distribution across clusters. Contact support if you reach the limit.
> - Unlinked workspaces are moved to Pay-As-You-Go pricing tier.

Use the following commands to unlink a workspace from cluster:

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Select your cluster from **Log Analytics dedicated clusters** menu in the Azure portal and then click **Linked workspaces** to view all workspaces currently linked to the dedicated cluster. Select any workspaces you want to unlink and click **Unlink**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/logs-dedicated-cluster/unlink-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot for unlinking a workspace from a dedicated cluster in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/logs-dedicated-cluster/unlink-workspace.png":::

## Delete cluster

You need to have *write* permissions on the cluster resource. 

Cluster deletion operation should be done with caution, since operation is non-recoverable. All ingested data to cluster from linked workspaces, gets permanently deleted. 

The cluster's billing stops when cluster is deleted, regardless of the 31-days commitment tier defined in cluster.

If you delete a cluster that has linked workspaces, workspaces get automatically unlinked from the cluster, workspaces are moved to pay-as-you-go pricing tier, and new data to workspaces is ingested to Log Analytics clusters instead. You can query workspace for the time range before it was linked to the cluster, and after the unlink, and the service performs cross-cluster queries seamlessly.

> [!NOTE] 
> - There is a limit of seven clusters per subscription and region, five active, plus two that were deleted in past two weeks.
> - Cluster's name remain reserved two weeks after deletion, and can't be used for creating a new cluster.

Use the following commands to delete a cluster:

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Select your cluster from **Log Analytics dedicated clusters** menu in the Azure portal and then click **Delete**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/logs-dedicated-cluster/delete-cluster.png" alt-text="Screenshot for deleting a dedicated cluster in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/logs-dedicated-cluster/delete-cluster.png":::

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

Remove-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name"
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Use the following REST call to delete a cluster:

```rest
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/<cluster-name>?api-version=2022-10-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

  **Response**

## Limits and constraints

- A maximum of five active clusters can be created in each region and subscription.

- A maximum of seven clusters allowed per subscription and region, five active, plus two that were deleted in past 2 weeks.

- A maximum of 1,000 Log Analytics workspaces can be linked to a cluster.

- A maximum of two workspace link operations on particular workspace is allowed in 30 day period.

- Moving a cluster to another resource group or subscription isn't currently supported.

- Moving a cluster to another region isn't supported.

- Cluster update shouldn't include both identity and key identifier details in the same operation. In case you need to update both, the update should be in two consecutive operations.

- Lockbox isn't currently available in China. 

- Lockbox can't currently be applied to tables with the [Auxiliary plan](data-platform-logs.md#table-plans).

- [Double encryption](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption#doubly-encrypt-data-with-infrastructure-encryption) is configured automatically for clusters created from October 2020 in supported regions. You can verify if your cluster is configured for double encryption by sending a GET request on the cluster and observing that the `isDoubleEncryptionEnabled` value is `true` for clusters with Double encryption enabled. 
  - If you create a cluster and get an error "region-name doesn't support Double Encryption for clusters.", you can still create the cluster without Double encryption by adding `"properties": {"isDoubleEncryptionEnabled": false}` in the REST request body.
  - Double encryption setting can't be changed after the cluster has been created.

- Deleting a workspace is permitted while linked to cluster. If you decide to [recover](./delete-workspace.md#recover-a-workspace-in-a-soft-delete-state) the workspace during the [soft-delete](./delete-workspace.md#delete-a-workspace-into-a-soft-delete-state) period, workspace returns to previous state and remains linked to cluster.

- During the commitment period, you can change to a higher commitment tier, which restarts the 31-day commitment period. You can't move back to pay-as-you-go or to a lower commitment tier until after you finish the commitment period.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get conflict error when creating a cluster, it might have been deleted in past 2 weeks and in deletion process yet. The cluster name remains reserved during the 2 weeks deletion period and you can't create a new cluster with that name.

- If you update your cluster while the cluster is at provisioning or updating state, the update will fail.

- Some operations are long and can take a while to complete. These are *cluster create*, *cluster key update* and *cluster delete*. You can check the operation status by sending GET request to cluster or workspace and observe the response. For example, unlinked workspace won't have the *clusterResourceId* under *features*.

- If you attempt to link a Log Analytics workspace that's already linked to another cluster, the operation will fail.
