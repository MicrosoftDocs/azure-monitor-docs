# Enhance data and service resilience in Azure Monitor Logs with availability zones

[Azure availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) protect applications and data from datacenter failures and can enhance the resilience of Azure Monitor features that rely on a Log Analytics workspace. In some regions, availability zones protect all Log Analytics workspaces by default. In other regions, you need to link your workspace to a dedicated cluster for availability zone protection. This article describes the data and service resilience benefits Azure Monitor availability zones provide, and lists the level of support provided in each region.

> [!NOTE]
> Application Insights resources can use availability zones only if they're workspace-based. Classic Application Insights resources can't use availability zones.

## Prerequisites

- A Log Analytics workspace linked to a shared or [dedicated cluster](logs-dedicated-clusters.md).  Azure Monitor creates Log Analytics workspaces in a shared cluster, unless you set up a dedicated cluster for your workspaces.



## How availability zones enhance data and service resilience in Azure Monitor Logs

Each Azure region that supports availability zones is made of one or more datacenters, or zones, equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. 

Azure Monitor Logs availability zones are [zone-redundant](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview#zonal-and-zone-redundant-services), which means that Microsoft manages spreading service requests and replicating data across different zones in supported regions. If one zone is affected by an incident, Microsoft manages failover to a different availability zone in the region automatically. You don't need to take any action because switching between zones is seamless. 

A subset of the availability zones that support data resilience currently also support service resilience for Azure Monitor Logs. In regions that support **service resilience**, Azure Monitor Logs service operations - for example, log ingestion, queries, and alerts - can continue in the event of a zone failure. In regions that only support **data resilience**, your stored data is protected against zonal failures, but service operations might be impacted by regional incidents.

> [!NOTE]
> Moving to a dedicated cluster in a region that supports availablility zones protects data ingested after the move, not historical data.
