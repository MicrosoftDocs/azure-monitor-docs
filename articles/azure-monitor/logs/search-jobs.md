# Run search jobs in Azure Monitor

A search job is an asynchronous query you run on any data in your Log Analytics - in both [interactive and long-term retention](data-retention-configure.md) - that makes the query results available for interactive queries in a new search table within your workspace. The search job uses parallel processing and can run for hours across large datasets. This article describes how to create a search job and how to query its resulting data.

This video explains when and how to use search jobs:

## Permissions required

| Action | Permissions required |
|:-------|:---------------------|
| Run a search job | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/write` and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/searchJobs/write` permissions to the Log Analytics workspace, for example, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](../logs/manage-access.md#built-in-roles). |

> [!NOTE]
> Cross-tenant search jobs aren't currently supported, even when Entra ID tenants are managed through Azure Lighthouse.

## When to use search jobs

Use search jobs to: 

- Retrieve records from [long-term retention](data-retention-configure.md) and [tables with the Basic and Auxiliary plans](data-platform-logs.md#table-plans) into a new Analytics table where you can take advantage of Azure Monitor Log's full analytics capabilities. 
- Scan through large volumes of data, if the log query time-out of 10 minutes isn't sufficient.

## What does a search job do?

A search job sends its results to a new table in the same workspace as the source data. The results table is available as soon as the search job begins, but it may take time for results to begin to appear. 

The search job results table is an [Analytics table](../logs/logs-table-plans.md) that is available for log queries and other Azure Monitor features that use tables in a workspace. The table uses the [retention value](data-retention-configure.md) set for the workspace, but you can modify this value after the table is created.

The search results table schema is based on the source table schema and the specified query. The following other columns help you track the source records:

| Column                 | Value                                    |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| _OriginalType          | *Type* value from source table.          |
| _OriginalItemId        | *_ItemID* value from source table.       |
| _OriginalTimeGenerated | *TimeGenerated* value from source table. |
| TimeGenerated          | Time at which the search job ran.        |

Queries on the results table appear in [log query auditing](query-audit.md) but not the initial search job.

## Run a search job

Run a search job to fetch records from large datasets into a new search results table in your workspace.

> [!TIP] 
> You incur charges for running a search job. Therefore, write and optimize your query in interactive query mode before running the search job.  

### [Portal](#tab/portal-1)

To run a search job, in the Azure portal:

1. From the **Log Analytics workspace** menu, select **Logs**.

1. Type a search job query or just select the table you want. 

1. Select the ellipsis menu on the right-hand side of the screen and select **Search job**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/search-job/search-job-menu-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Logs screen with the Search job menu item highlighted." lightbox="media/search-job/search-job-menu-selection.png"::: 

1. Specify the search job date range using the time picker. The maximum range is one year, but can be any one year period the data retention period allows.

    If your Kusto query also specifies a time range, the union of the time ranges is used for the search job.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/search-job/search-job-time-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the search job interface prompting for time range and the search job results table." lightbox="media/search-job/search-job-time-selector.png":::

1. Enter a name for the search job result table and select **Run a search job**.

    Azure Monitor Logs runs the search job and creates a new table in your workspace for your search job results. 

1. When the new table is ready, select **View '*\<searchtablename\>*_SRCH'** to view the table in Log Analytics.

    Search job results are available as they begin flowing into the newly created search job results table.

    :::image type="content" source="media/search-job/search-job-running.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows search job results table with data." lightbox="media/search-job/search-job-running.png":::

    Azure Monitor Logs shows a **Search job is done** message when it's completed. When you see that message or the progress shows 100%, the results table is now ready with all the records that match the search query.

### [API](#tab/api-1)

To run a search job, call the **Tables - Create or Update** API. The call includes the name of the results table to be created. The name of the results table must end with *_SRCH*.
 
```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/<TableName>_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Request body**

Include the following values in the body of the request:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| properties.searchResults.query           | string  | Log query written in KQL to retrieve data.                                         |
| properties.searchResults.limit           | integer | Maximum number of records in the result set, up to one million records. (Optional) |
| properties.searchResults.startSearchTime | string  | Start of the time range to search.                                                 |
| properties.searchResults.endSearchTime   | string  | End of the time range to search.                                                   |

**Sample request**

This example creates a table called *Syslog_suspected_SRCH* with the results of a query that searches for particular records in the *Syslog* table.

**Request**

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/testWS/tables/Syslog_suspected_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Request body**

```json
{
    "properties": { 
        "searchResults": {
                "query": "Syslog | where * has 'suspected.exe'",
                "limit": 1000,
                "startSearchTime": "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",

            }
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status code: 202 accepted.

### [CLI](#tab/cli-1)

To run a search job, run the [az monitor log-analytics workspace table search-job create](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/table/search-job#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-table-search-job-create) command. The name of the results table, which you set using the `--name` parameter, must end with *_SRCH*.

**Example**

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics workspace table search-job create --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG  --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name HeartbeatByIp_SRCH --search-query 'Heartbeat | where ComputerIP has "00.000.00.000"' --limit 1500 --start-search-time "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" --end-search-time "2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z" --no-wait
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell-1)

To run a search job, run the [New-AzOperationalInsightsSearchTable](/powershell/module/az.operationalinsights/new-azoperationalinsightssearchtable) command. The name of the results table, which you set using the `TableName` parameter, must end with *_SRCH*.

**Example**

```powershell
New-AzOperationalInsightsSearchTable -ResourceGroupName ContosoRG -WorkspaceName ContosoWorkspace -TableName HeartbeatByIp_SRCH -SearchQuery "Heartbeat" -StartSearchTime "01-01-2022 00:00:00" -EndSearchTime "01-01-2022 00:00:00"
```

### [Portal](#tab/portal-2)

1. From the **Log Analytics workspace** menu, select **Logs**.

1. From **Tables** > **Search results**, hover over your search results table to view the progress. 

    The icon on the search job results table displays an update indicator icon until the search job is completed.  
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/search-job/search-job-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Tables tab on Logs screen in the Azure portal with the search results tables listed under Search results." lightbox="media/search-job/search-job-status.png":::

### [API](#tab/api-2)

Call the **Tables - Get** API to get the status and details of a search job:
```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/<TableName>_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Table status**

Each search job table has a property called *provisioningState*, which can have one of the following values:

| Status     | Description                           |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------|
| Updating   | Populating the table and its schema.  |
| InProgress | Search job is running, fetching data. |

### [CLI](#tab/cli-2)

To check the status and details of a search job table, run the [az monitor log-analytics workspace table show](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/table#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-table-show) command.

**Example**

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics workspace table show --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name HeartbeatByIp_SRCH --output table \
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell-2)

To check the status and details of a search job table, run the [Get-AzOperationalInsightsTable](/powershell/module/az.operationalinsights/get-azoperationalinsightstable) command.

**Example**

```powershell
Get-AzOperationalInsightsTable -ResourceGroupName "ContosoRG" -WorkspaceName "ContosoWorkspace" -tableName "HeartbeatByIp_SRCH"
```

> [!NOTE]
> When "-TableName" isn't provided, the command lists all tables associated with a workspace.

## Delete a search job table

We recommend you [delete the search job table](../logs/create-custom-table.md#delete-a-table) when you're done querying the table. This best practice reduces workspace clutter and extra charges for data retention. 

## Limitations

Search jobs are subject to the following limitations:

* Optimized to query one table at a time.
* Search date range is up to one year.
* Supports long running searches up to a 24-hour time-out.
* Results are limited to one million records in the record set.
* Concurrent execution is limited to five search jobs per workspace.
* Limited to 100 search results tables per workspace.
* Limited to 100 search job executions per day per workspace. 

When you reach the record limit, Azure aborts the job with a status of *partial success*, and the table contains only records ingested up to that point. 

### KQL query limitations

Search jobs are intended to scan large volumes of data in a specific table. Therefore, search job queries must always start with a table name. To enable asynchronous execution using distribution and segmentation, the query supports a subset of KQL, including the operators: 

* `[where](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator)`
* `[extend](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/extendoperator)`
* `[project](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator)`
* `[project-away](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectawayoperator)`
* `[project-keep](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/project-keep-operator)`
* `[project-rename](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectrenameoperator)`
* `[project-reorder](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectreorderoperator)`
* `[parse](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parse-operator)`
* `[parse-where](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parse-where-operator)`

You can use all functions and binary operators within these operators.

## Pricing model

The search job charge is based on:

* Search job execution: 

  - **Analytics plan** - The amount of data the search job scans that's in long-term retention. There's no charge for scanning data that's in interactive retention in Analytics tables.
  - **Basic or Auxiliary plans** - All data the search job scans in both interactive and long-term retention. 
    
    The data scanned is defined as the volume of data in the table that you run the search job on, within the time range you specified. For more information about interactive and long-term retention, see [Manage data retention in a Log Analytics workspace](data-retention-configure.md).
  
* Search job results - The amount of data the search job finds and is ingested into the results table, based on the data ingestion rate for Analytics tables.

For example, if a search on a Basic table spans 30 days and the table holds 500 GB of data per day, you're charged for 15,000 GB of scanned data. If the search job returns 1,000 records, you're charged for ingesting these 1,000 records into the results table.
