# Azure Monitor Log Analytics API response format

The Azure Monitor Log Analytics API response is a JSON string that contains an array of table objects.

The `tables` property is an array of tables that represent the query result. Each table contains `name`, `columns`, and `rows` properties:

 - The `name` property is the name of the table.
 - The `columns` property is an array of objects that describe the schema of each column.
 - The `rows` property is an array of values. Each item in the array represents a row in the result set.

In the following example, we can see that the result contains two columns: `Category` and `count_`. The first column, `Category`, represents the value of the `Category` column in the `AzureActivity` table. The second column, `count_` is the count of the number of events in the `AzureActivity` table for the specific category.

## Azure Monitor Log Analytics API errors

If a fatal error occurs during query execution, an error status code is returned with a [OneAPI](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#errorresponse--object) error object that describes the error.

If a non-fatal error occurs during query execution, the response status code is `200 OK`. It contains the query results in the `tables` property as described. The response also contains an `error` property, which is a OneAPI error object with the code `PartialError`. Details of the error are included in the `details` property.
