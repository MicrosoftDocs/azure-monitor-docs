# Timeouts

Query execution times can vary widely based on:

- The complexity of the query.
- The amount of data being analyzed.
- The load on the system at the time of the query.
- The load on the workspace at the time of the query.

You might want to customize the timeout for the query. The default timeout is 3 minutes. The maximum timeout is 10 minutes.

## Timeout request header

To set the timeout, use the `Prefer` header in the HTTP request by using the standard `wait` preference. For more information, see [this website](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-4.3). The `Prefer` header puts an upper limit, in seconds, on how long the client waits for the service to process the query.

## Response

If a query takes longer than the specified timeout (or default timeout, if unspecified), it fails with a status code of 504 Gateway Timeout.

For example, the following request allows a maximum server timeout age of 30 seconds:

```
    POST https://api.loganalytics.azure.com/v1/workspaces/{workspace-id}/query
    Authorization: Bearer <access token>
    Prefer: wait=30
    
    {
        "query" : "Heartbeat | count"
    }
```
