# Register an App to request authorization tokens and work with APIs

To access Azure REST APIs such as the Log analytics API, or to send custom metrics, you can generate an authorization token based on a client ID and secret. The token is then passed in your REST API request. This article shows you how to register a client app and create a client secret so that you can generate a token.

## Register an App

Create a service principal and register an app using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell.
### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. To register an app, open the Active Directory Overview page in the Azure portal.

1. Select **App registrations** from the side bar.

1. Select **New registration**
1. On the Register an application page, enter a **Name** for the application. 
1. Select **Register**

1. On the app's overview page, select **Certificates and Secrets**
1. Note the **Application (client) ID**. It's used in the HTTP request for a token.

1. In the **Client secrets tab** Select **New client secret**
1. Enter a **Description** and select **Add**
 :::image type="content" source="../media/api-register-app/add-a-client-secret.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Add client secret page.":::
  
1. Copy and save the client secret **Value**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > Client secret values can only be viewed immediately after creation. Be sure to save the secret before leaving the page.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)


Run the following script to create a service principal and app. 

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <Service principal display name> 

```
The response looks as follows:
```JSON
{
  "appId": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",
  "displayName": "AzMonAPIApp",
  "password": "123456.ABCDE.~XYZ876123ABcEdB7169",
  "tenant": "aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e"
}

```
>[!Important]
> The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control.

Add a role and scope for the resources that you want to access using the API

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee <`appId`> --role <Role> --scope <resource URI>
```

The CLI following example assigns the `Reader` role to the service principal for all resources in the `rg-001`resource group:

```azurecli
 az role assignment create --assignee 00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444 --role Reader --scope '\/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg-001'
```
For more information on creating a service principal using Azure CLI, see [Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli).

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
The following sample script demonstrates creating a Microsoft Entra service principal via PowerShell. For a more detailed walkthrough, see [using Azure PowerShell to create a service principal to access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell)  

```powershell
$subscriptionId = "{azure-subscription-id}"
$resourceGroupName = "{resource-group-name}"

# Authenticate to a specific Azure subscription.
Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

# Password for the service principal
$pwd = "{service-principal-password}"
$secureStringPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $pwd -AsPlainText -Force

# Create a new Azure Active Directory application
$azureAdApplication = New-AzADApplication `
                        -DisplayName "My Azure Monitor" `
                        -HomePage "https://localhost/azure-monitor" `
                        -IdentifierUris "https://localhost/azure-monitor" `
                        -Password $secureStringPassword

# Create a new service principal associated with the designated application
New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId

# Assign Reader role to the newly created service principal
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader `
                          -ServicePrincipalName $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid

```

## Next steps

Before you can generate a token using your app, client ID, and secret, assign the app to a role using Access control (IAM) for resource that you want to access. The role will depend on the resource type and the API that you want to use.  
For example,
- To grant your app read from a Log Analytics Workspace, add your app as a member to the **Reader** role using Access control (IAM) for your Log Analytics Workspace. For more information, see [Access the API](./access-api.md)

- To grant access to send custom metrics for a resource,  add your app as a member to the **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role using Access control (IAM) for your resource. For more information, see [Send metrics to the Azure Monitor metric database using REST API](../../essentials/metrics-store-custom-rest-api.md)

For more information, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal)

Once you've assigned a role, you can use your app, client ID, and client secret to generate a bearer token to access the REST API.

> [!NOTE]
> When using Microsoft Entra authentication, it may take up to 60 minutes for the Azure Application Insights REST API to recognize new role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. While permissions are propagating, REST API calls may fail with error code 403.
