# Tables that support the Basic table plan in Azure Monitor Logs

All custom tables created with or migrated to the [Logs ingestion API](logs-ingestion-api-overview.md), and the Azure tables listed below support the [Basic table plan](../logs/logs-table-plans.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Tables created with the [Data Collector API](data-collector-api.md) don't support the Basic table plan.

[!INCLUDE [basictables](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/tables/basic-tables-include.md)]
