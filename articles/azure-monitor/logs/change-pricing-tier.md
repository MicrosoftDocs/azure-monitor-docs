# Change pricing tier for Log Analytics workspace
Each Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor can have a different [pricing tier](cost-logs.md#commitment-tiers). This article describes how to change the pricing tier for a workspace and how to track these changes.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to change the commitment tier for a Log Analytics workspace once you determine which commitment tier you want to use. See [Azure Monitor Logs pricing details](cost-logs.md) for details on how commitment tiers work and [Azure Monitor cost and usage](../cost-usage.md#log-analytics-workspace) for recommendations on the most cost effective commitment based on your observed Azure Monitor usage.

## Permissions required

| Action | Permissions required |
|:-------|:---------------------|
| Change pricing tier | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/*/write` permissions to the Log Analytics workspace, as provided by the [Log Analytics Contributor built-in role](./manage-access.md#log-analytics-contributor), for example |


## Changing pricing tier

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)
Use the following steps to change the pricing tier of your workspace using the Azure portal.

1. From the **Log Analytics workspaces** menu, select your workspace, and open **Usage and estimated costs**. This displays a list of each of the pricing tiers available for this workspace.

2. Review the estimated costs for each pricing tier. This estimate assumes that your usage in the last 31 days is typical. 

3. Choose the tier with the lowest estimated cost. This tier is labeled **Recommended Tier**.

3. Click **Select** if you decide to change the pricing tier after reviewing the estimated costs.

4. Review the commitment message in the popup that "Commitment Tier pricing has a 31-day commitment period, during which the workspace cannot be moved to a lower Commitment Tier or any Consumption Tier" and select **Change pricing tier** to confirm. 

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)
To set the pricing tier using an [Azure Resource Manager](./resource-manager-workspace.md), use the `sku` object to set the pricing tier and the `capacityReservationLevel` parameter if the pricing tier is `capacityresrvation`. For details on this template format, see [Microsoft.OperationalInsights workspaces](/azure/templates/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces)

The following sample template sets a workspace to a 300 GB/day commitment tier. To set the pricing tier to other values such as Pay-As-You-Go (called `pergb2018` for the SKU), omit the `capacityReservationLevel` property.

```
{
  "$schema": https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#,
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "YourWorkspaceName",
      "type": "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces",
      "apiVersion": "2020-08-01",
      "location": "yourWorkspaceRegion",
      "properties": {
                    "sku": {
                      "name": "capacityreservation",
                      "capacityReservationLevel": 300
                    }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

See [Deploying the sample templates](../resource-manager-samples.md) if you're not familiar with using Resource Manager templates.

## Tracking pricing tier changes
Changes to a workspace's pricing tier are recorded in the [Activity Log](../essentials/activity-log.md). Filter for events with an **Operation** of *Create Workspace*. The event's **Change history** tab shows the old and new pricing tiers in the  `properties.sku.name` row. To monitor changes the pricing tier, [create an alert](../alerts/alerts-activity-log.md) for the *Create Workspace* operation.
