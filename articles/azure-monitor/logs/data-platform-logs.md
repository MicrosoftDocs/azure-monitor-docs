# Azure Monitor Logs overview

Azure Monitor Logs is a centralized software as a service (SaaS) platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data generated by Azure and non-Azure resources and applications.

You can collect logs, manage log data and costs, and consume different types of data in one [Log Analytics workspace](#log-analytics-workspace), the primary Azure Monitor Logs resource. This means you never have to move data or manage other storage, and you can retain different data types for as long or as little as you need.

This article provides an overview of how Azure Monitor Logs works and explains how it addresses the needs and skills of different personas in an organization.    

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor Logs is one half of the data platform that supports Azure Monitor. The other is [Azure Monitor Metrics](../essentials/data-platform-metrics.md), which stores numeric data in a time-series database. 

## How Azure Monitor Logs works

Azure Monitor Logs provides you with the tools to: 

* **Collect any data** by using Azure Monitor data collection methods. Transform data based on your needs to optimize costs, remove personal data, and so on, and route data to tables in your Log Analytics workspace.
* **Manage and optimize log data and costs** by configuring your Log Analytics workspace and log tables, including table schemas, table plans, data retention, data aggregation, who has access to which data, and log-related costs.
* **Retrieve data in near-real time** by using Kusto Query language (KQL), or KQL-based tools and features that don't require KQL knowledge, such as Simple mode in the Log Analytics user interface, prebuilt curated monitoring experiences called Insights, and predefined queries.
* **Use data flexibly** for a range of use cases, including data analysis, troubleshooting, alerting, dashboards and reports, custom applications, and other Azure or non-Azure services.

## Data collection, routing, and transformation

Azure Monitor's data collection capabilities let you collect data from all of your applications and resources running in Azure, other clouds, and on-premises. A powerful ingestion pipeline enables filtering, transforming, and routing data to destination tables in your Log Analytics workspace to optimize costs, analytics capabilities, and query performance.

For more information on data collection and transformation, see [Azure Monitor data sources and data collection methods](../data-sources.md) and [Data collection transformations in Azure Monitor](../essentials/data-collection-transformations.md).

## Log Analytics workspace    

A [Log Analytics workspace](../logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md) is a data store that holds tables into which you collect data. 

To address the data storage and consumption needs of various personas who use a Log Analytics workspace, you can:

- [Define table plans](#table-plans) based on your data consumption and cost management needs.
- [Manage low-cost long-term retention and interactive retention](../logs/data-retention-configure.md) for each table.
- [Manage access](../logs/manage-access.md) to the workspace and to specific tables.
- [Use summary rules to aggregate critical data](../logs/summary-rules.md) in summary tables. This lets you optimize data for ease of use and actionable insights, and store raw data in a table with a low-cost table plan for however long you need it.
- Create ready-to-run [saved queries](../logs/save-query.md), [visualizations](../best-practices-analysis.md#built-in-visualization-tools), and [alerts](../alerts/alerts-create-log-alert-rule.md) tailored to specific personas.

You can also configure network isolation, replicate your workspace across regions, and [design a workspace architecture based on your business needs](../logs/workspace-design.md).


## Table plans

You can use one Log Analytics workspace to store any type of log required for any purpose. For example:

- High-volume, verbose data that requires **cheap long-term storage for audit and compliance**
- App and resource data for **troubleshooting** by developers
- Key event and performance data for scaling and alerting to ensure ongoing **operational excellence and security**
- Aggregated long-term data trends for **advanced analytics and machine learning** 

Table plans let you manage data costs based on how often you use the data in a table and the type of analysis you need the data for.

This video provides an overview of how table plans enable multi-tier logging in Azure Monitor Logs:

## Kusto Query Language (KQL) and Log Analytics 

You retrieve data from a Log Analytics workspace using a [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) query, which is a read-only request to process data and return results. KQL is a powerful tool that can analyze millions of records quickly. Use KQL to explore your logs, transform and aggregate data, discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, and more.  

Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal for running log queries and analyzing their results. [Log Analytics Simple mode](log-analytics-simple-mode.md) lets any user, regardless of their knowledge of KQL, retrieve data from one or more tables with one click. A set of controls lets you explore and analyze the retrieved data using the most popular Azure Monitor Logs functionality in an intuitive, spreadsheet-like experience.

:::image type="content" source="media/log-analytics-explorer/log-analytics-simple-mode-user-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Log Analytics Simple mode." lightbox="media/log-analytics-explorer/log-analytics-simple-mode-user-interface.png":::

If you're familiar with KQL, you can use Log Analytics KQL mode to edit and create queries, which you can then use in Azure Monitor features such as alerts and workbooks, or share with other users. 

For more information about Log Analytics, see [Overview of Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](./log-analytics-overview.md). 

## Built-in insights and custom dashboards, workbooks, and reports

Many of Azure Monitor's [ready-to-use, curated Insights experiences](../insights/insights-overview.md) store data in Azure Monitor Logs, and present this data in an intuitive way so you can monitor the performance and availability of your cloud and hybrid applications and their supporting components.

:::image type="content" source="../containers/media/container-insights-overview/azmon-containers-experience.png" lightbox="../containers/media/container-insights-overview/azmon-containers-experience.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows the built-in Container Insights monitoring experience in Azure Monitor.":::

You can also [create your own visualizations and reports](../best-practices-analysis.md#built-in-visualization-tools) using workbooks, dashboards, and Power BI.  

## Use cases 

This table describes some of the ways that you can use the data you collect in Azure Monitor Logs to derive operational and business value.

|  Capability | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Analyze | Use [Log Analytics](./log-analytics-tutorial.md) in the Azure portal to write [log queries](./log-query-overview.md) and interactively analyze log data by using a powerful analysis engine. |
| Aggregate| Use [summary rules](./summary-rules.md) to aggregate information you need for alerting and analysis from the raw log data you ingest. This lets you optimize your costs, analysis capabilities, and query performance. |

| Retrieve | Access log query results from:<ul><li>The command line using [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics) or [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/module/az.operationalinsights).</li><li>A custom app using the [REST API](/rest/api/loganalytics/) or client library for [.NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/Monitor.Query-readme), [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/monitor/azquery), [Java](/java/api/overview/azure/monitor-query-readme), [JavaScript](/javascript/api/overview/azure/monitor-query-readme), or [Python](/python/api/overview/azure/monitor-query-readme).</li></ul> |
| Import | Upload logs from a custom app via the [REST API](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-ingestion-api-overview) or client library for [.NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/Monitor.Ingestion-readme), [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/monitor/ingestion/azlogs), [Java](/java/api/overview/azure/monitor-ingestion-readme), [JavaScript](/javascript/api/overview/azure/monitor-ingestion-readme), or [Python](/python/api/overview/azure/monitor-ingestion-readme). |
| Export | Configure [automated export of log data](./logs-data-export.md) to an Azure Storage account or Azure Event Hubs.<br>Build a workflow to retrieve log data and copy it to an external location by using [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/connectors/connectors-azure-monitor-logs). |
| Bring your own analysis | [Analyze data in Azure Monitor Logs using a notebook](../logs/notebooks-azure-monitor-logs.md) to create streamlined, multi-step processes on top of data you collect in Azure Monitor Logs. This is especially useful for purposes such as [building and running machine learning pipelines](../logs/aiops-machine-learning.md#create-your-own-machine-learning-pipeline-on-data-in-azure-monitor-logs), advanced analysis, and troubleshooting guides (TSGs) for Support needs. |
| Retain data for auditing and compliance | [Send data directly to a table with the Auxiliary plan](./create-custom-table-auxiliary.md) and [extend retention of data in any table](./data-retention-configure.md) to keep data for auditing and compliance to up to 12 years. The low-cost Auxiliary table plan and in-workspace, long-term retention let you reduce costs and use your data quickly and easily when you need it.|

## Working with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud
