## Cookie management

Starting from version 2.6.0, the Azure Application Insights JavaScript SDK provides instance-based cookie management that can be disabled and re-enabled after initialization.

If you disabled cookies during initialization using the `disableCookiesUsage` or `cookieCfg.enabled` configurations, you can re-enable them using the `setEnabled` function of the [ICookieMgr object](https://microsoft.github.io/ApplicationInsights-JS/webSdk/applicationinsights-core-js/interfaces/ICookieMgr.html).

The instance-based cookie management replaces the previous CoreUtils global functions of `disableCookies()`, `setCookie()`, `getCookie()`, and `deleteCookie()`.

To take advantage of the tree-shaking enhancements introduced in version 2.6.0, it's recommended to no longer use the global functions.

### Cookie configuration

ICookieMgrConfig is a cookie configuration for instance-based cookie management added in 2.6.0. The options provided allow you to enable or disable the use of cookies by the SDK. You can also set custom cookie domains and paths and customize the functions for fetching, setting, and deleting cookies.

The ICookieMgrConfig options are defined in the following table.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| enabled | boolean | true | The current instance of the SDK uses this boolean to indicate whether the use of cookies is enabled. If false, the instance of the SDK initialized by this configuration doesn't store or read any data from cookies. |
| domain | string | null | Custom cookie domain. It's helpful if you want to share Application Insights cookies across subdomains. If not provided uses the value from root `cookieDomain` value. |
| path | string | / | Specifies the path to use for the cookie, if not provided it uses any value from the root `cookiePath` value. |
| ignoreCookies | string[] | undefined | Specify the cookie name(s) to be ignored, it causes any matching cookie name to never be read or written. They may still be explicitly purged or deleted. You don't need to repeat the name in the `blockedCookies` configuration. (since v2.8.8)
| blockedCookies | string[] | undefined | Specify the cookie name(s) to never write. It prevents creating or updating any cookie name, but they can still be read unless also included in the ignoreCookies. They may still be purged or deleted explicitly. If not provided, it defaults to the same list in ignoreCookies. (Since v2.8.8)
| getCookie | `(name: string) => string` | null | Function to fetch the named cookie value, if not provided it uses the internal cookie parsing / caching. |
| setCookie | `(name: string, value: string) => void` | null | Function to set the named cookie with the specified value, only called when adding or updating a cookie. |
| delCookie | `(name: string, value: string) => void` | null | Function to delete the named cookie with the specified value, separated from setCookie to avoid the need to parse the value to determine whether the cookie is being added or removed. If not provided it uses the internal cookie parsing / caching. |

## Source map

Source map support helps you debug minified JavaScript code with the ability to unminify the minified callstack of your exception telemetry.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Compatible with all current integrations on the **Exception Details** panel
> - Supports all current and future JavaScript SDKs, including Node.JS, without the need for an SDK upgrade

### Link to Blob Storage account

Application Insights supports the uploading of source maps to your Azure Storage account blob container. You can use source maps to unminify call stacks found on the **End-to-end transaction details** page. You can also use source maps to unminify any exception sent by the [JavaScript SDK][ApplicationInsights-JS] or the [Node.js SDK][ApplicationInsights-Node.js].

:::image type="content" source="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/details-unminify.gif" lightbox="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/details-unminify.gif" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the option to unminify a call stack by linking with a storage account.":::

#### Create a new storage account and blob container

If you already have an existing storage account or blob container, you can skip this step.

1. [Create a new storage account][create storage account].
1. [Create a blob container][create blob container] inside your storage account. Set **Public access level** to **Private** to ensure that your source maps aren't publicly accessible.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/container-access-level.png" lightbox="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/container-access-level.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows setting the container access level to Private.":::

#### Push your source maps to your blob container

Integrate your continuous deployment pipeline with your storage account by configuring it to automatically upload your source maps to the configured blob container.

You can upload source maps to your Azure Blob Storage container with the same folder structure they were compiled and deployed with. A common use case is to prefix a deployment folder with its version, for example, `1.2.3/static/js/main.js`. When you unminify via an Azure blob container called `sourcemaps`, the pipeline tries to fetch a source map located at `sourcemaps/1.2.3/static/js/main.js.map`.

##### Upload source maps via Azure Pipelines (recommended)

If you're using Azure Pipelines to continuously build and deploy your application, add an [Azure file copy][azure file copy] task to your pipeline to automatically upload your source maps.

:::image type="content" source="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/azure-file-copy.png" lightbox="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/azure-file-copy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding an Azure file copy task to your pipeline to upload your source maps to Azure Blob Storage.":::

#### Configure your Application Insights resource with a source map storage account

You have two options for configuring your Application Insights resource with a source map storage account.

##### End-to-end transaction details tab

From the **End-to-end transaction details** tab, select **Unminify**. Configure your resource if it's unconfigured.

1. In the Azure portal, view the details of an exception that's minified.
1. Select **Unminify**.
1. If your resource isn't configured, configure it.

##### Properties tab

To configure or change the storage account or blob container that's linked to your Application Insights resource:

1. Go to the **Properties** tab of your Application Insights resource.
1. Select **Change source map Blob Container**.
1. Select a different blob container as your source map container.
1. Select **Apply**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/reconfigure.png" lightbox="./media/javascript-sdk-configuration/reconfigure.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows reconfiguring your selected Azure blob container on the Properties pane.":::

### View the unminified callstack
 
To view the unminified callstack, select an Exception Telemetry item in the Azure portal, find the source maps that match the call stack, and drag and drop the source maps onto the call stack in the Azure portal. The source map must have the same name as the source file of a stack frame, but with a `map` extension.

## Tree shaking

Tree shaking eliminates unused code from the final JavaScript bundle.

To take advantage of tree shaking, import only the necessary components of the SDK into your code. By doing so, unused code isn't included in the final bundle, reducing its size and improving performance.

### Tree shaking enhancements and recommendations

In version 2.6.0, we deprecated and removed the internal usage of these static helper classes to improve support for tree-shaking algorithms. It lets npm packages safely drop unused code.

- `CoreUtils`
- `EventHelper`
- `Util`
- `UrlHelper`
- `DateTimeUtils`
- `ConnectionStringParser`

 The functions are now exported as top-level roots from the modules, making it easier to refactor your code for better tree-shaking.

The static classes were changed to const objects that reference the new exported functions, and future changes are planned to further refactor the references.

### Tree shaking deprecated functions and replacements

This section only applies to you if you're using the deprecated functions and you want to optimize package size. We recommend using the replacement functions to reduce size and support all the versions of Internet Explorer.

## Service notifications

Service notifications is a feature built into the SDK to provide actionable recommendations to help ensure your telemetry flows uninterrupted to Application Insights. You'll see the notifications as an exception message within Application Insights. We ensure notifications are relevant to you based on your SDK settings, and we adjust the verbosity based on the urgency of the recommendation. We recommend leaving service notifications on, but you're able to opt out via the `featureOptIn` configuration. See below for a list of active notifications.

Currently, no active notifications are being sent.

Service notifications are managed by the JavaScript SDK, which regularly polls a public JSON file to control and update these notifications. To disable the polling made by the JavaScript SDK, disable the [featureOptIn mode](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/blob/main/docs/WebConfig.md#basic-usage).

## Troubleshooting

See the dedicated [troubleshooting article](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-monitor/app-insights/javascript-sdk-troubleshooting).

## Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to common questions.

### How can I update my third-party server configuration for the JavaScript SDK?

The server side needs to be able to accept connections with those headers present. Depending on the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` configuration on the server side, it's often necessary to extend the server-side list by manually adding `Request-Id`, `Request-Context`, and `traceparent` (W3C distributed header).

Access-Control-Allow-Headers: `Request-Id`, `traceparent`, `Request-Context`, `<your header>`

### How can I disable distributed tracing for the JavaScript SDK?

Distributed tracing can be disabled in configuration.

### Are the HTTP 502 and 503 responses always captured by Application Insights?

No. The "502 bad gateway" and "503 service unavailable" errors aren't always captured by Application Insights. If only client-side JavaScript is being used for monitoring, this behavior would be expected because the error response is returned prior to the page containing the HTML header with the monitoring JavaScript snippet being rendered.
          
If the 502 or 503 response was sent from a server with server-side monitoring enabled, the errors are collected by the Application Insights SDK.
          
Even when server-side monitoring is enabled on an application's web server, sometimes a 502 or 503 error isn't captured by Application Insights. Many modern web servers don't allow a client to communicate directly. Instead, they employ solutions like reverse proxies to pass information back and forth between the client and the front-end web servers.
          
In this scenario, a 502 or 503 response might be returned to a client because of an issue at the reverse proxy layer, so it isn't captured out-of-box by Application Insights. To help detect issues at this layer, you might need to forward logs from your reverse proxy to Log Analytics and create a custom rule to check for 502 or 503 responses. To learn more about common causes of 502 and 503 errors, see [Troubleshoot HTTP errors of "502 bad gateway" and "503 service unavailable" in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-http-502-http-503).
