# Configure the Application Insights SDK with ApplicationInsights.config or .xml

The Application Insights .NET SDK consists of many NuGet packages. The [core package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights) provides the API for sending telemetry to the Application Insights. [More packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.ApplicationInsights) provide telemetry *modules* and *initializers* for automatically tracking telemetry from your application and its context. By adjusting the configuration file, you can enable or disable telemetry modules and initializers. You can also set parameters for some of them.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-app-insights-otel-available-notification](../includes/azure-monitor-app-insights-otel-available-notification.md)]

The configuration file is named `ApplicationInsights.config` or `ApplicationInsights.xml`. The name depends on the type of your application. It's automatically added to your project when you [install most versions of the SDK][start]. By default, when you use the automated experience from the Visual Studio template projects that support **Add** > **Application Insights Telemetry**, the `ApplicationInsights.config` file is created in the project root folder. When it's compiled, it's copied to the bin folder. It's also added to a web app by [Application Insights Agent on an IIS server][redfield]. The configuration file is ignored if the [extension for Azure websites](azure-web-apps.md) or the [extension for Azure VMs and virtual machine scale sets](azure-vm-vmss-apps.md) is used.

There isn't an equivalent file to control the [SDK in a webpage][client].

This article describes the sections you see in the configuration file, how they control the components of the SDK, and which NuGet packages load those components.

> [!NOTE]
> The `ApplicationInsights.config` and .xml instructions don't apply to the .NET Core SDK. To configure .NET Core applications, follow the instructions in [Application Insights for ASP.NET Core applications](./asp-net-core.md).

## Telemetry modules (ASP.NET)

Each telemetry module collects a specific type of data and uses the core API to send the data. The modules are installed by different NuGet packages, which also add the required lines to the .config file.

There's a node in the configuration file for each module. To disable a module, delete the node or comment it out.

### Dependency tracking

[Dependency tracking](./asp-net-dependencies.md) collects telemetry about calls your app makes to databases and external services and databases. To allow this module to work in an IIS server, you need to [install Application Insights Agent][redfield].

You can also write your own dependency tracking code by using the [TrackDependency API](./api-custom-events-metrics.md#trackdependency).

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DependencyCollector.DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule`
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DependencyCollector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DependencyCollector) NuGet package

Dependencies can be autocollected without modifying your code by using agent-based (codeless) attach. To use it in Azure web apps, enable the [Application Insights extension](azure-web-apps.md). To use it in an Azure VM or an Azure virtual machine scale set, enable the [Application Monitoring extension for VMs and virtual machine scale sets](azure-vm-vmss-apps.md).

### Performance collector

The performance collector [collects system performance counters](./performance-counters.md), such as CPU, memory, and network load from IIS installations. You can specify which counters to collect, including performance counters you've set up yourself.

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.PerfCounterCollector.PerformanceCollectorModule`
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.PerfCounterCollector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.PerfCounterCollector) NuGet package

### Application Insights diagnostics telemetry

The `DiagnosticsTelemetryModule` class reports errors in the Application Insights instrumentation code itself. Examples are if the code can't access performance counters or if `ITelemetryInitializer` throws an exception. Trace telemetry tracked by this module appears in the [Diagnostic Search][diagnostic].

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Implementation.Tracing.DiagnosticsTelemetryModule`
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights) NuGet package. If you only install this package, the ApplicationInsights.config file is not automatically created.

### Developer mode

The `DeveloperModeWithDebuggerAttachedTelemetryModule` class forces the Application Insights `TelemetryChannel` to send data immediately, one telemetry item at a time, when a debugger is attached to the application process. This design reduces the amount of time between the moment when your application tracks telemetry and when it appears in the Application Insights portal. It causes significant overhead in CPU and network bandwidth.

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.DeveloperModeWithDebuggerAttachedTelemetryModule`
* [Application Insights Windows Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer/) NuGet package

### Web request tracking

Web request tracking reports the [response time and result code](../../azure-monitor/app/asp-net.md) of HTTP requests.

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web.RequestTrackingTelemetryModule`
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web) NuGet package

### Exception tracking

The `ExceptionTrackingTelemetryModule` class tracks unhandled exceptions in your web app. For more information, see [Failures and exceptions][exceptions].

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web.ExceptionTrackingTelemetryModule`.
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web) NuGet package.
* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.UnobservedExceptionTelemetryModule`: Tracks unobserved task. exceptions.
* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.UnhandledExceptionTelemetryModule`: Tracks unhandled exceptions for worker roles, Windows services, and console applications.
* [Application Insights Windows Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer/) NuGet package.

### EventSource tracking

The `EventSourceTelemetryModule` class allows you to configure EventSource events to be sent to Application Insights as traces. For information on tracking EventSource events, see [Using EventSource events](./asp-net-trace-logs.md#use-eventsource-events).

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.EventSourceListener.EventSourceTelemetryModule`
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.EventSourceListener](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.EventSourceListener)

### ETW event tracking

The `EtwCollectorTelemetryModule` class allows you to configure events from ETW providers to be sent to Application Insights as traces. For information on tracking ETW events, see [Using ETW events](../../azure-monitor/app/asp-net-trace-logs.md#use-etw-events).

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.EtwCollector.EtwCollectorTelemetryModule`
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.EtwCollector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.EtwCollector)

### Microsoft.ApplicationInsights

The `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights` package provides the [core API](/dotnet/api/microsoft.applicationinsights) of the SDK. The other telemetry modules use this API. You can also [use it to define your own telemetry](./api-custom-events-metrics.md).

* No entry in ApplicationInsights.config.
* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights) NuGet package. If you just install this NuGet, no .config file is generated.

## Telemetry channel

The [telemetry channel](telemetry-channels.md) manages buffering and transmission of telemetry to the Application Insights service.

* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.ServerTelemetryChannel` is the default channel for web applications. It buffers data in memory and employs retry mechanisms and local disk storage for more reliable telemetry delivery.
* `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.InMemoryChannel` is a lightweight telemetry channel. It's used if no other channel is configured.

## Telemetry initializers (ASP.NET)

Telemetry initializers set context properties that are sent along with every item of telemetry.

You can [write your own initializers](./api-filtering-sampling.md#add-properties) to set context properties.

The standard initializers are all set either by the web or WindowsServer NuGet packages:

* `AccountIdTelemetryInitializer` sets the `AccountId` property.
* `AuthenticatedUserIdTelemetryInitializer` sets the `AuthenticatedUserId` property as set by the JavaScript SDK.
* `AzureRoleEnvironmentTelemetryInitializer` updates the `RoleName` and `RoleInstance` properties of the `Device` context for all telemetry items with information extracted from the Azure runtime environment.
* `BuildInfoConfigComponentVersionTelemetryInitializer` updates the `Version` property of the `Component` context for all telemetry items with the value extracted from the `BuildInfo.config` file produced by MS Build.
* `ClientIpHeaderTelemetryInitializer` updates the `Ip` property of the `Location` context of all telemetry items based on the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header of the request.
* `DeviceTelemetryInitializer` updates the following properties of the `Device` context for all telemetry items.
  * `Type` is set to `PC`.
  * `Id` is set to the domain name of the computer where the web application is running.
  * `OemName` is set to the value extracted from the `Win32_ComputerSystem.Manufacturer` field by using WMI.
  * `Model` is set to the value extracted from the `Win32_ComputerSystem.Model` field by using WMI.
  * `NetworkType` is set to the value extracted from the `NetworkInterface` property.
  * `Language` is set to the name of the `CurrentCulture` property.
* `DomainNameRoleInstanceTelemetryInitializer` updates the `RoleInstance` property of the `Device` context for all telemetry items with the domain name of the computer where the web application is running.
* `OperationNameTelemetryInitializer` updates the `Name` property of `RequestTelemetry` and the `Name` property of the `Operation` context of all telemetry items based on the HTTP method, and the names of the ASP.NET MVC controller and action invoked to process the request.
* `OperationIdTelemetryInitializer` or `OperationCorrelationTelemetryInitializer` updates the `Operation.Id` context property of all telemetry items tracked while handling a request with the automatically generated `RequestTelemetry.Id`.
* `SessionTelemetryInitializer` updates the `Id` property of the `Session` context for all telemetry items with value extracted from the `ai_session` cookie generated by the `ApplicationInsights` JavaScript instrumentation code running in the user's browser.
* `SyntheticTelemetryInitializer` or `SyntheticUserAgentTelemetryInitializer` updates the `User`, `Session`, and `Operation` context properties of all telemetry items tracked when handling a request from a synthetic source, such as an availability test or search engine bot. By default, [metrics explorer](../essentials/metrics-charts.md) doesn't display synthetic telemetry.

    The `<Filters>` set identifying properties of the requests.
* `UserTelemetryInitializer` updates the `Id` and `AcquisitionDate` properties of the `User` context for all telemetry items with values extracted from the `ai_user` cookie generated by the Application Insights JavaScript instrumentation code running in the user's browser.
* `WebTestTelemetryInitializer` sets the user ID, session ID, and synthetic source properties for HTTP requests that come from [availability tests](availability-overview.md). The `<Filters>` set identifying properties of the requests.

For .NET applications running in Azure Service Fabric, you can include the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.ServiceFabric` NuGet package. This package includes a `FabricTelemetryInitializer` property, which adds Service Fabric properties to telemetry items. For more information, see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-ServiceFabric/blob/master/README.md) about the properties added by this NuGet package.

## Telemetry processors (ASP.NET)

Telemetry processors can filter and modify each telemetry item before it's sent from the SDK to the portal.

You can [write your own telemetry processors](./api-filtering-sampling.md#filtering).

#### Adaptive sampling telemetry processor (from 2.0.0-beta3)

This functionality is enabled by default. If your app sends considerable telemetry, this processor removes some of it.

```xml

    <TelemetryProcessors>
      <Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor, Microsoft.AI.ServerTelemetryChannel">
        <MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond>5</MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond>
      </Add>
    </TelemetryProcessors>

```

The parameter provides the target that the algorithm tries to achieve. Each instance of the SDK works independently. So, if your server is a cluster of several machines, the actual volume of telemetry will be multiplied accordingly.

Learn more about [sampling](./sampling.md).

#### Fixed-rate sampling telemetry processor (from 2.0.0-beta1)

There's also a standard [sampling telemetry processor](./api-filtering-sampling.md) (from 2.0.1):

```xml

    <TelemetryProcessors>
     <Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.SamplingTelemetryProcessor, Microsoft.AI.ServerTelemetryChannel">

     <!-- Set a percentage close to 100/N where N is an integer. -->
     <!-- E.g. 50 (=100/2), 33.33 (=100/3), 25 (=100/4), 20, 1 (=100/100), 0.1 (=100/1000) -->
     <SamplingPercentage>10</SamplingPercentage>
     </Add>
   </TelemetryProcessors>

```

## ConnectionString

See connection string [code samples](connection-strings.md#code-samples).

## InstrumentationKey

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor-instrumentation-key-deprecation.md)]

This setting determines the Application Insights resource in which your data appears. Typically, you create a separate resource, with a separate key, for each of your applications.

If you want to set the key dynamically, for example, if you want to send results from your application to different resources, you can omit the key from the configuration file and set it in code instead.

To set the key for all instances of `TelemetryClient`, including standard telemetry modules, do this step in an initialization method, such as global.aspx.cs in an ASP.NET service:

```csharp
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        TelemetryConfiguration configuration = TelemetryConfiguration.CreateDefault();
        configuration.InstrumentationKey = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx";
        var telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(configuration);

```

If you want to send a specific set of events to a different resource, you can set the key for a specific telemetry client:

```csharp

    var tc = new TelemetryClient();
    tc.Context.InstrumentationKey = "----- my key ----";
    tc.TrackEvent("myEvent");
    // ...

```

To get a new key, [create a new resource in the Application Insights portal][new].

## ApplicationId Provider

_The provider is available starting in v2.6.0_.

The purpose of this provider is to look up an application ID based on an instrumentation key. The application ID is included in `RequestTelemetry` and `DependencyTelemetry` and is used to determine correlation in the portal.

This functionality is available by setting `TelemetryConfiguration.ApplicationIdProvider` either in code or in the config file.

### Interface: IApplicationIdProvider

```csharp
public interface IApplicationIdProvider
{
    bool TryGetApplicationId(string instrumentationKey, out string applicationId);
}
```

We provide two implementations in the [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights) SDK: `ApplicationInsightsApplicationIdProvider` and `DictionaryApplicationIdProvider`.

### ApplicationInsightsApplicationIdProvider

This wrapper is for our Profile API. It will throttle requests and cache results.

This provider is added to your config file when you install either [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DependencyCollector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DependencyCollector) or [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web/).

This class has an optional property `ProfileQueryEndpoint`. By default, it's set to `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/api/profiles/{0}/appId`. If you need to configure a proxy for this configuration, we recommend that you proxy the base address and include `"/api/profiles/{0}/appId"`. A `{0}` is substituted at runtime per request with the instrumentation key.

#### Example configuration via ApplicationInsights.config

```xml
<ApplicationInsights>
    ...
    <ApplicationIdProvider Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Implementation.ApplicationId.ApplicationInsightsApplicationIdProvider, Microsoft.ApplicationInsights">
        <ProfileQueryEndpoint>https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/api/profiles/{0}/appId</ProfileQueryEndpoint>
    </ApplicationIdProvider>
    ...
</ApplicationInsights>
```

#### Example configuration via code

```csharp
TelemetryConfiguration.Active.ApplicationIdProvider = new ApplicationInsightsApplicationIdProvider();
```

### DictionaryApplicationIdProvider

This static provider relies on your configured instrumentation key/application ID pairs.

This class has the `Defined` property, which is a `Dictionary<string,string>` of instrumentation key/application ID pairs.

This class has the optional property `Next`, which can be used to configure another provider to use when an instrumentation key is requested that doesn't exist in your configuration.

#### Example configuration via ApplicationInsights.config

```xml
<ApplicationInsights>
    ...
    <ApplicationIdProvider Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Implementation.ApplicationId.DictionaryApplicationIdProvider, Microsoft.ApplicationInsights">
        <Defined>
            <Type key="InstrumentationKey_1" value="ApplicationId_1"/>
            <Type key="InstrumentationKey_2" value="ApplicationId_2"/>
        </Defined>
        <Next Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.Implementation.ApplicationId.ApplicationInsightsApplicationIdProvider, Microsoft.ApplicationInsights" />
    </ApplicationIdProvider>
    ...
</ApplicationInsights>
```

#### Example configuration via code

```csharp
TelemetryConfiguration.Active.ApplicationIdProvider = new DictionaryApplicationIdProvider{
 Defined = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        {"InstrumentationKey_1", "ApplicationId_1"},
        {"InstrumentationKey_2", "ApplicationId_2"}
    }
};
```
