   Official FAQ for Azure Monitor Application Insights. Find answers to questions about using Application Insights with Azure Monitor.


sections:
  - name: Overview
    questions:
      - question: How do I instrument an application?
        answer: |
          For detailed information about instrumenting applications to enable Application Insights, see [data collection basics](opentelemetry-overview.md).

      - question: How do I use Application Insights?
        answer: |
          After enabling Application Insights by [instrumenting an application](opentelemetry-overview.md), we suggest first checking out [Live metrics](live-stream.md) and the [Application map](app-map.md).

      - question: What telemetry does Application Insights collect?
        answer: |
          From server web apps:

          * HTTP requests.
          * [Dependencies](./asp-net-dependencies.md). Calls to SQL databases, HTTP calls to external services, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Table Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Queue Storage.
          * [Exceptions](./asp-net-exceptions.md) and stack traces.
          * [Performance counters](./asp-net-counters.md): Performance counters are available when using:
             * [Azure Monitor Application Insights agent](application-insights-asp-net-agent.md)
             * [Azure monitoring for VMs or virtual machine scale sets](./azure-vm-vmss-apps.md)
             * [Application Insights `collectd` writer](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/deprecated-java-2x#collectd-linux-performance-metrics-in-application-insights-deprecated).
          * [Custom events and metrics](./api-custom-events-metrics.md) that you code.
          * [Trace logs](./asp-net-trace-logs.md) if you configure the appropriate collector.
          
          From [client webpages](./javascript-sdk.md):
          
          * Uncaught exceptions in your app, including information on
             * Stack trace
             * Exception details and message accompanying the error
             * Line & column number of error
             * URL where error was raised
             * Network Dependency Requests made by your app XML Http Request (XHR) and Fetch (fetch collection is disabled by default) requests, include information on:
                * Url of dependency source
                * Command & Method used to request the dependency
                * Duration of the request
                * Result code and success status of the request
                * ID (if any) of user making the request
                * Correlation context (if any) where request is made
          * User information (for example, Location, network, IP)
          * Device information (for example, Browser, OS, version, language, model)
          * Session information

             > [!NOTE]
             > For some applications, such as single-page applications (SPAs), the duration isn't always recorded and, in those cases, defaults to 0.

             For more information, see [Data collection, retention, and storage in Application Insights](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-retention-privacy).
          
           From other sources, if you configure them:
          
           * [Azure diagnostics](../agents/diagnostics-extension-to-application-insights.md)
           * [Import to Log Analytics](../logs/data-collector-api.md)
           * [Log Analytics](../logs/data-collector-api.md)
           * [Logstash](../logs/data-collector-api.md)
    
    



  - name: Application Insights API for custom events and metrics
    questions:
      - question: Why am I missing telemetry data?
        answer: |
          Both [TelemetryChannels](telemetry-channels.md#what-are-telemetry-channels) will lose buffered telemetry if it isn't flushed before an application shuts down.

          To avoid data loss, flush the TelemetryClient when an application is shutting down.

          For more information, see [Flushing data](#flushing-data).
          
      - question: What exceptions might `Track_()` calls throw?
        answer: |
          None. You don't need to wrap them in try-catch clauses. If the SDK encounters problems, it will log messages in the debug console output and, if the messages get through, in Diagnostic Search.

      - question: Is there a REST API to get data from the portal?
        answer: |
          Yes, the [data access API](/rest/api/application-insights/). Other ways to extract data include [Power BI](..\logs\log-powerbi.md) on [workspace-based resource](create-workspace-resource.md).

      - question: Why are my calls to custom events and metrics APIs ignored?
        answer: |
          The Application Insights SDK isn't compatible with autoinstrumentation. If autoinstrumentation is enabled, calls to <code class="notranslate">Track()</code> and other custom events and metrics APIs will be ignored.

          Turn off autoinstrumentation in the Azure portal on the Application Insights tab of the App Service page or set <code class="notranslate">ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION</code> to <code class="notranslate">disabled</code>.
          
      - question: Why are the counts in Search and Metrics charts unequal?
        answer: |
           [Sampling](./sampling.md) reduces the number of telemetry items (like requests and custom events) that are sent from your app to the portal. In Search, you see the number of items received. In metric charts that display a count of events, you see the number of original events that occurred.
          
           Each item that's transmitted carries an `itemCount` property that shows how many original events that item represents. To observe sampling in operation, you can run this query in Log Analytics:
          
           ```
           requests | summarize original_events = sum(itemCount), transmitted_events = count()
           ```
        
      - question: How can I set an alert on an event?
        answer: |
             Azure alerts are only on metrics. Create a custom metric that crosses a value threshold whenever your event occurs. Then set an alert on the metric. You get a notification whenever the metric crosses the threshold in either direction. You won't get a notification until the first crossing, no matter whether the initial value is high or low. There's always a latency of a few minutes.
