      - question: How do I instrument an application?
        answer: |
          For detailed information about instrumenting applications to enable Application Insights, see [data collection basics](opentelemetry-overview.md).

      - question: How do I use Application Insights?
        answer: |
          After enabling Application Insights by [instrumenting an application](opentelemetry-overview.md), we suggest first checking out [Live metrics](live-stream.md) and the [Application map](app-map.md).

      - question: What telemetry does Application Insights collect?
        answer: |
          From server web apps:

          * HTTP requests.
          * [Dependencies](./asp-net-dependencies.md). Calls to SQL databases, HTTP calls to external services, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Table Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Queue Storage.
          * [Exceptions](./asp-net-exceptions.md) and stack traces.
          * [Performance counters](./asp-net-counters.md): Performance counters are available when using:
             * [Azure Monitor Application Insights agent](application-insights-asp-net-agent.md)
             * [Azure monitoring for VMs or virtual machine scale sets](./azure-vm-vmss-apps.md)
             * [Application Insights `collectd` writer](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/deprecated-java-2x#collectd-linux-performance-metrics-in-application-insights-deprecated).
          * [Custom events and metrics](./api-custom-events-metrics.md) that you code.
          * [Trace logs](./asp-net-trace-logs.md) if you configure the appropriate collector.
          
          From [client webpages](./javascript-sdk.md):
          
          * Uncaught exceptions in your app, including information on
             * Stack trace
             * Exception details and message accompanying the error
             * Line & column number of error
             * URL where error was raised
             * Network Dependency Requests made by your app XML Http Request (XHR) and Fetch (fetch collection is disabled by default) requests, include information on:
                * Url of dependency source
                * Command & Method used to request the dependency
                * Duration of the request
                * Result code and success status of the request
                * ID (if any) of user making the request

      - question: How many Application Insights resources should I deploy?
        answer: |
          To understand the number of Application Insights resources required to cover your application or components across environments, see the [Application Insights deployment planning guide](create-workspace-resource.md#how-many-application-insights-resources-should-i-deploy).  

      - question: How can I manage Application Insights resources with PowerShell?
        answer: |
          You can [write PowerShell scripts](./powershell.md) by using Azure Resource Monitor to:
          
          * Create and update Application Insights resources.
          * Set the pricing plan.
          * Get the instrumentation key.
          * Add a metric alert.
          * Add an availability test.
          
          You can't set up a metrics explorer report or set up continuous export.    

      - question: How can I query Application Insights telemetry? 
        answer: |
           Use the [REST API](/rest/api/application-insights/) to run [Log Analytics](../logs/log-query-overview.md) queries.

      - question: Can I send telemetry to the Application Insights portal?
        answer: |
          We recommend the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](opentelemetry-enable.md).

          The [ingestion schema](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/tree/master/BASE/Schema/PublicSchema) and [endpoint protocol](https://github.com/MohanGsk/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/EndpointSpecs/ENDPOINT-PROTOCOL.md) are available publicly.    

      - question: How long does it take for telemetry to be collected?
        answer: |
           Most Application Insights data has a latency of under 5 minutes. Some data can take longer, which is typical for larger log files. See the [Application Insights service-level agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/application-insights/v1_2/).    

      - question: How does Application Insights handle data collection, retention, storage, and privacy?
        answer: |
          #### Collection

          Application Insights collects telemetry about your app, including web server telemetry, web page telemetry, and performance counters. This data can be used to monitor your app's performance, health, and usage. You can select the location when you [create a new Application Insights resource](./create-workspace-resource.md).

          #### Retention and Storage

          Data is sent to an Application Insights [Log Analytics workspace](../logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md). You can choose the retention period for raw data, from 30 to 730 days. Aggregated data is retained for 90 days, and debug snapshots are retained for 15 days.

          #### Privacy

          Application Insights doesn't handle sensitive data by default. We recommend you don't put sensitive data in URLs as plain text and ensure your custom code doesn't collect personal or other sensitive details. During development and testing, check the sent data in your IDE and browser's debugging output windows.

          For archived information, see [Data collection, retention, and storage in Application Insights](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-retention-privacy).

      - question: What is the Application Insights pricing model?
        answer: |
          Application Insights is billed through the Log Analytics workspace into which its log data ingested. The default Pay-as-you-go Log Analytics pricing tier includes 5 GB per month of free data allowance per billing account. Learn more about [Azure Monitor logs pricing options](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

      - question: Are there data transfer charges between an Azure web app and Application Insights?
        answer: |
          * If your Azure web app is hosted in a datacenter where there's an Application Insights collection endpoint, there's no charge.
          * If there's no collection endpoint in your host datacenter, your app's telemetry incurs [Azure outgoing charges](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/).
          
          This answer depends on the distribution of our endpoints, *not* on where your Application Insights resource is hosted.   

      - question: Do I incur network costs if my Application Insights resource is monitoring an Azure resource (that is, telemetry producer) in a different region?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can incur more network costs, which vary depending on the region the telemetry is coming from and where it's going. Refer to [Azure bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/) for details.

          If you're seeing unexpected charges or high costs in Application Insights, this guide can help. It covers common causes like high telemetry volume, data ingestion spikes, and misconfigured sampling. It's especially useful if you're troubleshooting issues related to cost spikes, telemetry volume, sampling not working, data caps, high ingestion, or unexpected billing. To get started, see [Troubleshoot high data ingestion in Application Insights](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-monitor/app-insights/telemetry/troubleshoot-high-data-ingestion).

      - question: What TLS versions are supported?
        answer: |
          Application Insights uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 and 1.3.

          > [!IMPORTANT]
          >  On 1 March 2025, Azure will retire legacy versions of TLS across all services. At that time, Application Insights no longer supports TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and the listed legacy TLS 1.2/1.3 cipher suites and elliptic curves.

          For any general questions around the legacy TLS problem, see [Solving TLS problems](/security/engineering/solving-tls1-problem) and [Azure Resource Manager TLS Support](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tls-support).

  - name: Application Insights API for custom events and metrics
    questions:
      - question: Why am I missing telemetry data?
        answer: |
          Both [TelemetryChannels](telemetry-channels.md#what-are-telemetry-channels) will lose buffered telemetry if it isn't flushed before an application shuts down.

          To avoid data loss, flush the TelemetryClient when an application is shutting down.

          For more information, see [Flushing data](api-custom-events-metrics.md#flushing-data).
          
      - question: What exceptions might Track_() calls throw?
        answer: |
          None. You don't need to wrap them in try-catch clauses. If the SDK encounters problems, it will log messages in the debug console output and, if the messages get through, in Diagnostic Search.

      - question: Is there a REST API to get data from the portal?
        answer: |
          Yes, the [data access API](/rest/api/application-insights/). Other ways to extract data include [Power BI](..\logs\log-powerbi.md) on [workspace-based resource](create-workspace-resource.md).

      - question: Why are my calls to custom events and metrics APIs ignored?
        answer: |
          The Application Insights SDK isn't compatible with autoinstrumentation. If autoinstrumentation is enabled, calls to <code class="notranslate">Track()</code> and other custom events and metrics APIs will be ignored.

          Turn off autoinstrumentation in the Azure portal on the Application Insights tab of the App Service page or set <code class="notranslate">ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION</code> to <code class="notranslate">disabled</code>.
          
      - question: Why are the counts in Search and Metrics charts unequal?
        answer: |
           [Sampling](./sampling.md) reduces the number of telemetry items (like requests and custom events) that are sent from your app to the portal. In Search, you see the number of items received. In metric charts that display a count of events, you see the number of original events that occurred.
          
           Each item that's transmitted carries an `itemCount` property that shows how many original events that item represents. To observe sampling in operation, you can run this query in Log Analytics:
          
           ```
           requests | summarize original_events = sum(itemCount), transmitted_events = count()
           ```
        
      - question: How can I set an alert on an event?
        answer: |
             Azure alerts are only on metrics. Create a custom metric that crosses a value threshold whenever your event occurs. Then set an alert on the metric. You get a notification whenever the metric crosses the threshold in either direction. You won't get a notification until the first crossing, no matter whether the initial value is high or low. There's always a latency of a few minutes.
     
  - name: Deploying Application Insights Agent for on-premises servers
    questions:
      - question: Does Application Insights Agent support proxy installations?
        answer: |
          Yes. There are multiple ways to download Application Insights Agent:

          * If your computer has internet access, you can onboard to the PowerShell Gallery by using `-Proxy` parameters.
          * You can also manually download the module and either install it on your computer or use it directly.

          Each of these options is described in the [detailed instructions](application-insights-asp-net-agent.md?tabs=detailed-instructions#instructions).  

      - question: Does Application Insights Agent support ASP.NET Core applications?
        answer: |
          Yes. In [Application Insights Agent 2.0.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.ApplicationMonitor/2.0.0) and later, ASP.NET Core applications hosted in IIS are supported.

      - question: How do I verify that the enablement succeeded?
        answer: |
          * You can use the [Get-ApplicationInsightsMonitoringStatus](application-insights-asp-net-agent.md?tabs=api-reference#get-applicationinsightsmonitoringstatus) cmdlet to verify that enablement succeeded.
          * Use [Live Metrics](./live-stream.md) to quickly determine if your app is sending telemetry.
          * You can also use [Log Analytics](../logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md) to list all the cloud roles currently sending telemetry:

              ```Kusto
              union * | summarize count() by cloud_RoleName, cloud_RoleInstance
              ```
      - question: How do I achieve proxy passthrough?
        answer: |  
          To achieve proxy passthrough, configure a machine-level proxy or an application-level proxy.
          See [DefaultProxy](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/defaultproxy-element-network-settings).

          Example Web.config:

          ```xml
          <system.net>
              <defaultProxy>
              <proxy proxyaddress="http://xx.xx.xx.xx:yyyy" bypassonlocal="true"/>
              </defaultProxy>
          </system.net>
          ```
  - name: TLS support 
    questions: 
      - question: Determine if TLS retirement affects you
        answer: |
          Application Insights and Azure Monitor don't control the TLS version used for HTTPS connections. The TLS version depends on the operating system and runtime environment where your application runs.

          To confirm the TLS version in use:

          - Review the documentation for your operating system and runtime or framework.
          - Contact the appropriate support team if you need further help. Don't open a support request with Application Insights.

          **Example language and runtime support for TLS 1.2+**

          The following versions include integrated support for TLS 1.2 or higher:

          - **.NET / .NET Core**: .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later, and all versions of .NET Core
          - **Java**: Java 8 update 161 (8u161) or later
          - **Python**: Python distributions built with OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later
          - **Node.js**: Node.js version 10 or later

          **Example operating system support for TLS 1.2+**

          The following operating systems include integrated support for TLS 1.2 or higher:

          - **Windows**: Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and later
          - **Linux**: Most modern Linux distributions that use OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later     

      - question: How do I ensure my resources aren't affected?
        answer: |
           To avoid service disruptions, each remote endpoint (including dependent requests) your resource interacts with needs to support at least one combination of the same Protocol Version, Cipher Suite, and Elliptical Curve mentioned earlier. If the remote endpoint doesn't support the needed TLS configuration, it needs to be updated with support for some combination of the post-deprecation TLS configuration.

      - question: After May 1, 2025, what is the behavior for affected resources?
        answer: |
          Affected Application Insights resources stop ingesting data and can't access required application components. As a result, some features stop working.

      - question: Which components does the deprecation affect?
        answer: |
          The Transport Layer Security (TLS) deprecation detailed in this document should only affect the behavior after May 1, 2025. For more information about CRUD operations, see [Azure Resource Manager TLS Support](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tls-support). This resource provides more details on TLS support and deprecation timelines.

      - question: Where can I get Transport Layer Security (TLS) support?
        answer: |
           For any general questions around the legacy TLS problem, see [Solving TLS problems](/security/engineering/solving-tls1-problem). 

  - name: ASP.NET
    questions:
      - question: How can I uninstall the SDK?
        answer: |
          To remove Application Insights, you need to remove the NuGet packages and references from the API in your application. You can uninstall NuGet packages by using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

          1. If trace collection is enabled, first uninstall the Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.TraceListener package by using the [NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#uninstall-a-package) but don't remove any dependencies.
          1. Uninstall the Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web package and remove its dependencies by using the [NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#uninstall-a-package) and its [Uninstall options](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#uninstall-options) within the [NuGet Package Manager Options control](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#nuget-package-manager-options-control).
          1. To fully remove Application Insights, check and manually delete the added code or files along with any API calls you added in your project. For more information, see [What is automatically created when you add the Application Insights SDK?](#what-is-automatically-created-when-you-add-the-application-insights-sdk).
      
      - question: What is automatically created when you add the Application Insights SDK?
        answer: |
          When you add Application Insights to your project, it automatically creates files and adds code to some of your files. Solely uninstalling the NuGet Packages doesn't always discard the files and code. To fully remove Application Insights, you should check and manually delete the added code or files along with any API calls you added in your project.

          When you add Application Insights Telemetry to a Visual Studio ASP.NET project, it adds the following files:

          * *ApplicationInsights.config*
          * *AiHandleErrorAttribute.cs*

          The following pieces of code are automatically added:

          * *[Your project's name].csproj*

          ```C#
           <ApplicationInsightsResourceId>/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/Default-ApplicationInsights-EastUS/providers/microsoft.insights/components/WebApplication4</ApplicationInsightsResourceId>

                  }
          ```

      - question: How can I disable telemetry correlation?
        answer: |
          To disable telemetry correlation in configuration, see `<ExcludeComponentCorrelationHttpHeadersOnDomains>` in [Application Insights for console applications](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/console).
  
  - name: ASP.NET Core applications
    questions:
      - question: Does Application Insights support ASP.NET Core 3.1?

          ASP.NET Core 3.1 is no longer supported by Microsoft.

          [Application Insights SDK for ASP.NET Core](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore) version 2.8.0 and Visual Studio 2019 or later can be used with ASP.NET Core 3.1 applications. 
      - question: How can I track telemetry that's not automatically collected?
        answer: |
          Get an instance of `TelemetryClient` by using constructor injection and call the required `TrackXXX()` method on it. We don't recommend creating new `TelemetryClient` or `TelemetryConfiguration` instances in an ASP.NET Core application. A singleton instance of `TelemetryClient` is already registered in the `DependencyInjection` container, which shares `TelemetryConfiguration` with the rest of the telemetry. Create a new `TelemetryClient` instance only if it needs a configuration that's separate from the rest of the telemetry.

          The following example shows how to track more telemetry from a controller.

          ```csharp
          using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;

          public class HomeController : Controller
          {
              private TelemetryClient telemetry;

              // Use constructor injection to get a TelemetryClient instance.
              public HomeController(TelemetryClient telemetry)
              {
                 this.telemetry = telemetry;
              }

              public IActionResult Index()
              {
                  // Call the required TrackXXX method.
                  this.telemetry.TrackEvent("HomePageRequested");
                  return View();
              }
          }
          ```

          For more information about custom data reporting in Application Insights, see [Application Insights custom metrics API reference](./api-custom-events-metrics.md). A similar approach can be used for sending custom metrics to Application Insights by using the [GetMetric API](./get-metric.md).    
         
      - question: How do I capture Request and Response body in my telemetry?
        answer: |
          ASP.NET Core has [built-in support](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-logging) for logging HTTP Request/Response information (including body) via [`ILogger`](asp-net-core.md#ilogger-logs). It's recommended to leverage this. This may potentially expose personally identifiable information (PII) in telemetry, and can cause costs (performance costs and Application Insights billing) to significantly increase, so evaluate the risks carefully before using this.

      - question: How do I customize ILogger logs collection?
        answer: |
          The default setting for Application Insights is to only capture **Warning** and more severe logs.

          Capture **Information** and less severe logs by changing the logging configuration for the Application Insights provider as follows.

          ```json
          {
              "Logging": {
                  "LogLevel": {
                      "Default": "Information"
                  },
                  "ApplicationInsights": {
                      "LogLevel": {
                          "Default": "Information"
                      }
                  }
              },
              "ApplicationInsights": {
                  "ConnectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
              }
          }
          ```

          It's important to note that the following example doesn't cause the Application Insights provider to capture `Information` logs. It doesn't capture it because the SDK adds a default logging filter that instructs `ApplicationInsights` to capture only `Warning` logs and more severe logs. Application Insights requires an explicit override.

          ```json
          {
              "Logging": {
                 "LogLevel": {
                     "Default": "Information"
                 }
              }
          }
          ```

          For more information, see [ILogger configuration](/dotnet/core/extensions/logging#configure-logging).

      - question: Some Visual Studio templates used the UseApplicationInsights() extension method on IWebHostBuilder to enable Application Insights. Is this usage still valid?
        answer: |
          The extension method `UseApplicationInsights()` is still supported, but it's marked as obsolete in Application Insights SDK version 2.8.0 and later. It's removed in the next major version of the SDK. To enable Application Insights telemetry, use `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` because it provides overloads to control some configuration. Also, in ASP.NET Core 3.X apps, `services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` is the only way to enable Application Insights.

      - question: I'm deploying my ASP.NET Core application to Web Apps. Should I still enable the Application Insights extension from Web Apps?
        answer: | 
          If the SDK is installed at build time as shown in this article, you don't need to enable the [Application Insights extension](./azure-web-apps.md) from the App Service portal. If the extension is installed, it backs off when it detects the SDK is already added. If you enable Application Insights from the extension, you don't have to install and update the SDK. But if you enable Application Insights by following instructions in this article, you have more flexibility because:

          * Application Insights telemetry continues to work in:
             * All operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac.
             * All publish modes, including self-contained or framework dependent.
             * All target frameworks, including the full .NET Framework.
             * All hosting options, including Web Apps, VMs, Linux, containers, AKS, and non-Azure hosting.
             * All .NET Core versions, including preview versions.
          * You can see telemetry locally when you're debugging from Visual Studio.
          * You can track more custom telemetry by using the `TrackXXX()` API.
          * You have full control over the configuration.

      - question: Can I enable Application Insights monitoring by using tools like Azure Monitor Application Insights Agent (formerly Status Monitor v2)?
        answer: |
          Yes. In [Application Insights Agent 2.0.0-beta1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.ApplicationMonitor/2.0.0-beta1) and later, ASP.NET Core applications hosted in IIS are supported.

      - question: Are all features supported if I run my application in Linux?
        answer: |
          Yes. Feature support for the SDK is the same in all platforms, with the following exceptions:

          * The SDK collects [event counters](./asp-net-counters.md) on Linux because [performance counters](./asp-net-counters.md) are only supported in Windows. Most metrics are the same.

      - question: Is this SDK supported for Worker Services?
        answer: |
          No. Instead, use [Application Insights for Worker Service applications (non-HTTP applications)](worker-service.md) for worker services.
            
      - question: How can I uninstall the SDK?
        answer: |
          To remove Application Insights, you need to remove the NuGet packages and references from the API in your application. You can uninstall NuGet packages by using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

          > [!NOTE]
          > These instructions are for uninstalling the ASP.NET Core SDK. If you need to uninstall the ASP.NET SDK, see [How can I uninstall the ASP.NET SDK?](#how-can-i-uninstall-the-sdk).

          1. Uninstall the Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore package by using the [NuGet Package Manager](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#uninstall-a-package).
          1. To fully remove Application Insights, check and manually delete the added code or files along with any API calls you added in your project. For more information, see [What is created when you add the Application Insights SDK?](#what-is-created-when-you-add-the-application-insights-sdk).

      - question: What is created when you add the Application Insights SDK?
        answer: |
          When you add Application Insights to your project, it creates files and adds code to some of your files. Solely uninstalling the NuGet Packages won't always discard the files and code. To fully remove Application Insights, you should check and manually delete the added code or files along with any API calls you added in your project.

          When you add Application Insights Telemetry to a Visual Studio ASP.NET Core template project, it adds the following code:

          * *[Your project's name].csproj*

          ```csharp
          <PropertyGroup>
              <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
              <ApplicationInsightsResourceId>/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/Default-ApplicationInsights-EastUS/providers/microsoft.insights/components/WebApplication4core</ApplicationInsightsResourceId>
          </PropertyGroup>
  
          <ItemGroup>
              <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore" Version="2.12.0" />
          </ItemGroup>
  
          <ItemGroup>
              <WCFMetadata Include="Connected Services" />
          </ItemGroup>
          ```

          * *Appsettings.json*

          ```json
          "ApplicationInsights": {
              "ConnectionString": "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
          }
          ```

          * *ConnectedService.json*
    
          ```json
          {    
              "ProviderId": "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.ConnectedService.ConnectedServiceProvider",
              "Version": "16.0.0.0",
              "GettingStartedDocument": {
                  "Uri": "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798432"
              }
          }
          ```
          * *Startup.cs*

          ```csharp
          public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
              {
                 services.AddRazorPages();
                 services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(); // This is added
              }
          ```

      - question: How can I disable telemetry correlation?
        answer: |
          To disable telemetry correlation in code, see `<ExcludeComponentCorrelationHttpHeadersOnDomains>` in [Application Insights for console applications](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/console).

  - name: ASP.NET performance counters      
    questions:
      - question: What's the difference between the Exception rate and Exceptions metrics?
        answer:  |
          * `Exception rate`: The Exception rate is a system performance counter. The CLR counts all the handled and unhandled exceptions that are thrown and divides the total in a sampling interval by the length of the interval. The Application Insights SDK collects this result and sends it to the portal.
          * `Exceptions`: The Exceptions metric counts the `TrackException` reports received by the portal in the sampling interval of the chart. It includes only the handled exceptions where you write `TrackException` calls in your code. It doesn't include all [unhandled exceptions](./asp-net-exceptions.md).  

  - name: ASP.NET event counters 
    questions:
      - question: Can I see EventCounters in Live Metrics?
        answer: |
          Live Metrics don't show EventCounters. Use Metric Explorer or Analytics to see the telemetry.

      - question: After I enabled Application Insights from the Azure Web App Portal, why can't I see event counters?
        answer: | 
          [Application Insights extension](./azure-web-apps.md) for ASP.NET Core doesn't yet support this feature.

  - name: Azure VMs and virtual machine scale sets
    questions:
      - question: How can I disable client-side monitoring for ASP.NET Core apps?
        answer: |  
          Client-side monitoring is enabled by default for ASP.NET Core apps. If you want to disable it, define an environment variable in the server with the following information:

          * **Name:** `APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED`
          * **Value:** `false`

  - name: Dependency tracking
    questions:
      - question: How does the automatic dependency collector report failed calls to dependencies?
        answer: |
          Failed dependency calls have the `success` field set to False. The module `DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule` doesn't report `ExceptionTelemetry`. The full data model for dependency is described in [Application Insights telemetry data model](data-model-complete.md#dependency-telemetry).

      - question: How do I calculate ingestion latency for my dependency telemetry?
        answer: |
          Use this code:

          ```kusto
          dependencies
          | extend E2EIngestionLatency = ingestion_time() - timestamp 
          | extend TimeIngested = ingestion_time()
          ```

      - question: How do I determine the time the dependency call was initiated?
        answer: |
          In the Log Analytics query view, `timestamp` represents the moment the TrackDependency() call was initiated, which occurs immediately after the dependency call response is received. To calculate the time when the dependency call began, you would take `timestamp` and subtract the recorded `duration` of the dependency call.

      - question: Does dependency tracking in Application Insights include logging response bodies?
        answer: |
          Dependency tracking in Application Insights doesn't include logging response bodies as it would generate too much telemetry for most applications.            
           
  - name: Availability tests
    questions:
      - question: Can I run availability tests on an intranet server?
        answer: |
          Availability tests run on points of presence that are distributed around the globe. There are two solutions:
          
          * **Firewall door**: Allow requests to your server from [the long and changeable list of web test agents](../fundamentals/azure-monitor-network-access.md).
          * **Custom code**: Write your own code to send periodic requests to your server from inside your intranet. You could run Visual Studio web tests for this purpose. The tester could send the results to Application Insights by using the `TrackAvailability()` API.

      - question: What is the user agent string for availability tests?
        answer: |
          The user agent string is **Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; AppInsights)**
       
  - name: TLS support for availability tests
    questions:
      - question: How does the deprecation impact my web test behavior?
        answer: |
          Availability tests act as a distributed client in each of the supported web test locations. Every time a web test is executed the availability test service attempts to reach out to the remote endpoint defined in the web test configuration. A TLS Client Hello message is sent which contains all the currently supported TLS configuration. If the remote endpoint shares a common TLS configuration with the availability test client, then the TLS handshake succeeds. Otherwise, the web test fails with a TLS handshake failure. 

      - question: How do I validate what TLS configuration a remote endpoint supports?
        answer: |
          There are several tools available to test what TLS configuration an endpoint supports. One way would be to follow the example detailed on this [page](/security/engineering/solving-tls1-problem#appendix-a-handshake-simulation). If your remote endpoint isn't available via the Public internet, you need to ensure you validate the TLS configuration supported on the remote endpoint from a machine that has access to call your endpoint. 

          > [!NOTE]
          > For steps to enable the needed TLS configuration on your web server, it is best to reach out to the team that owns the hosting platform your web server runs on if the process is not known. 

      - question: After May 1, 2025, what will the web test behavior be for impacted tests?
        answer: |
          There's no one exception type that all TLS handshake failures impacted by this deprecation would present themselves with. However, the most common exception your web test would start failing with would be `The request was aborted: Couldn't create SSL/TLS secure channel`. You should also be able to see any TLS related failures in the TLS Transport [Troubleshooting Step](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-monitor/app-insights/availability/diagnose-ping-test-failure) for the web test result that is potentially impacted. 

      - question: Can I view what TLS configuration is currently in use by my web test?
        answer: |
          The TLS configuration negotiated during a web test execution can't be viewed. As long as the remote endpoint supports common TLS configuration with availability tests, no impact should be seen post-deprecation. 

      - question: Which components does the deprecation affect in the availability test service?
        answer: |
          The TLS deprecation detailed in this document should only affect the availability test web test execution behavior after May 1, 2025. For more information about interacting with the availability test service for CRUD operations, see [Azure Resource Manager TLS Support](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tls-support). This resource provides more details on TLS support and deprecation timelines.

      - question: Where can I get TLS support?
        answer: |
          For any general questions around the legacy TLS problem, see [Solving TLS problems](/security/engineering/solving-tls1-problem).

  - name: Monitoring in Azure App Service for .NET, Node.js, Python, and Java applications
    questions:
      - question: What does Application Insights modify in my project?
        answer: |  
          The details depend on the type of project. The following list is an example for a web application.
          
          * **Adds files to your project:**
             * ApplicationInsights.config
             * ai.js

          * **Installs NuGet packages:**
             * Application Insights API: The core API
             * Application Insights API for Web Applications: Used to send telemetry from the server
             * Application Insights API for JavaScript Applications: Used to send telemetry from the client

          * **Includes assemblies in packages:**
            * Microsoft.ApplicationInsights
            * Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Platform

          * **Inserts items into:**
            * Web.config
            * packages.config

          * Inserts snippets into the client and server code to initialize them with the Application Insights resource ID. For example, in an MVC app, code is inserted into the main page *Views/Shared/\_Layout.cshtml*. For new projects only, you [add Application Insights to an existing project manually](./app-insights-overview.md).
        
      - question: What's the difference between standard metrics from Application Insights vs. Azure App Service metrics?
        answer: |
          Application Insights collects telemetry for the requests that made it to the application. If the failure occurs in WebApps/WebServer, and the request didn't reach the user application, Application Insights doesn't have any telemetry about it.

          The duration for `serverresponsetime` calculated by Application Insights doesn't necessarily match the server response time observed by Web Apps. This behavior is because Application Insights only counts the duration when the request actually reaches the user application. If the request is stuck or queued in WebServer, the waiting time is included in the Web Apps metrics but not in Application Insights metrics.

  - name: Autoinstrumentation
    questions:
      - question: Should the term "autoinstrumentation" be hyphenated?
        answer: |
          We follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens#prefixes) for product documentation published to the [Microsoft Learn](/) platform.

          In general, we don't include a hyphen after the "auto" prefix.
        
  - name: Connection strings 
    questions:
      - question: Do new Azure regions require the use of connection strings?
        answer: |
          New Azure regions *require* the use of connection strings instead of instrumentation keys. Connection string identifies the resource that you want to associate with your telemetry data. It also allows you to modify the endpoints your resource uses as a destination for your telemetry. Copy the connection string and add it to your application's code or to an environment variable.

      - question: Should I use connection strings or instrumentation keys?
        answer: |
          We recommend that you use connection strings instead of instrumentation keys.

      - question: When do I need to set the environment variable?
        answer: |
          Set the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` manually in all scenarios where the system doesn't provide it automatically. These scenarios include, but aren't limited to: local development and .NET Isolated Functions using ASP.NET Core integration. In these cases, the environment variable ensures the OpenTelemetry pipeline can send telemetry to Application Insights. For more information on configuring connection strings with an environment variable, see [Configuring OpenTelemetry in Application Insights](./opentelemetry-configuration.md#connection-string).

      - question: How do I instrument a global web application to meet regional data compliance requirements?
        answer: |
          To meet regional data compliance requirements, use regional Application Insights endpoints instead of the global endpoint. The global endpoint doesn't guarantee that data stays within a specific region. Regional endpoints help ensure that telemetry from users in regulated areas is sent only to data centers in those regions.

          To configure your global web application for regional compliance:

          - Create one Application Insights resource per region with strict compliance requirements, such as the European Union or the United States.
          - Create another Application Insights resource for users in all other regions.
          - Configure your application to send telemetry to the appropriate Application Insights resource based on each user’s region. Determine the region using signals like IP address, account metadata, or location settings.
          - Connect all Application Insights resources to a Log Analytics workspace if you need a unified query experience across regions.

          For example:
          - Send data from Region A users to the Region A Application Insights resource using the Region A connection string.
          - Send data from Region B users to the Region B Application Insights resource using the Region B connection string.
          - Send all other user data to a general-purpose Application Insights resource using a different connection string.

          > [!Important]
          > Using the global endpoint does not ensure regional compliance. To meet data residency requirements, always use region-specific endpoints and route telemetry based on the user’s region.

          The following diagram shows an example setup for a global web application:

          :::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-faq/routing-based-on-region.png" alt-text="Diagram showing routing based on region to specific App Insights resources." lightbox="media/application-insights-faq/routing-based-on-region.png":::

  - name: Creating and configuring Application Insights resources
    questions:
      - question: How do I move an Application Insights resource to a new region?
        answer: | 
          Transferring existing Application Insights resources between regions isn't supported, and you can't migrate historical data to a new region. The workaround involves:

          * Creating a new Application Insights resource in the desired region.
          * Re-creating any unique customizations from the original resource in the new one.
          * Updating your application with the new region resource's [connection string](./connection-strings.md).
          * Testing to ensure everything works as expected with the new Application Insights resource.
          * Decide to either keep or delete the original Application Insights resource. Deleting a classic resource means to lose all historical data. If the resource is workspace-based, the data remains in Log Analytics, enabling access to historical data until the retention period expires.

          Unique customizations that commonly need to be manually re-created or updated for the resource in the new region include but aren't limited to:

          * Re-create custom dashboards and workbooks.
          * Re-create or update the scope of any custom log/metric alerts.
          * Re-create availability alerts.
          * Re-create any custom Azure role-based access control settings that are required for your users to access the new resource.
          * Replicate settings involving ingestion sampling, data retention, daily cap, and custom metrics enablement. These settings are controlled via the **Usage and estimated costs** pane.
          * Any integration that relies on API keys, such as [release annotations](./release-and-work-item-insights.md?tabs=release-annotations) and [live metrics secure control channel](./live-stream.md#secure-the-control-channel). You need to generate new API keys and update the associated integration.
          * Continuous export in classic resources must be configured again.
          * Diagnostic settings in workspace-based resources must be configured again.

      - question: Can I use providers('Microsoft.Insights', 'components').apiVersions[0] in my Azure Resource Manager deployments?
        answer: |
          We don't recommend using this method of populating the API version. The newest version can represent preview releases, which might contain breaking changes. Even with newer non-preview releases, the API versions aren't always backward compatible with existing templates. In some cases, the API version might not be available to all subscriptions.
        
  - name: Telemetry data model
    questions:
      - question: How can I report data model or schema problems and suggestions?
        answer: |
          To report data model or schema problems and suggestions, use our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/issues/new/choose).

      - question: How would I measure the impact of a monitoring campaign?
        answer: |
          PageView Telemetry includes URL and you could parse the UTM parameter using a regex function in Kusto.

          Occasionally, this data might be missing or inaccurate if the user or enterprise disables sending User Agent in browser settings. The [UA Parser regexes](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/blob/master/regexes.yaml) might not include all device information. Or Application Insights might not have adopted the latest updates.

      - question: Why would a custom measurement succeed without error but the log doesn't show up?
        answer: |
          This can occur if you're using string values. Only numeric values work with custom measurements.
        
  - name: Logging with .NET
    questions:
      - question: What Application Insights telemetry type is produced from ILogger logs? Where can I see ILogger logs in Application Insights?
        answer: |
          `ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider` captures `ILogger` logs and creates `TraceTelemetry` from them. If an `Exception` object is passed to the `Log` method on `ILogger`, `ExceptionTelemetry` is created instead of `TraceTelemetry`. 

          **Viewing ILogger Telemetry**

          In the Azure portal:

          1. Go to the Azure portal and access your Application Insights resource.
          1. Select the **Logs** section inside Application Insights.
          1. Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query ILogger messages stored in the `traces` table.
              Example Query: `traces | where message contains "YourSearchTerm"`.
          1. Refine your queries to filter ILogger data by severity, time range, or specific message content.

          In Visual Studio (Local Debugger):

          1. Start your application in debug mode within Visual Studio.
          1. Open the **Diagnostic Tools** window while the application runs.
          1. In the **Events** tab, ILogger logs appear along with other telemetry data.
          1. To locate specific ILogger messages, use the search and filter features in the **Diagnostic Tools** window.

          If you prefer to always send `TraceTelemetry`, use this snippet:

          ```csharp
          builder.AddApplicationInsights(
              options => options.TrackExceptionsAsExceptionTelemetry = false);
          ```

      - question: Why do some ILogger logs not have the same properties as others?
        answer: |
          Application Insights captures and sends `ILogger` logs by using the same `TelemetryConfiguration` information that's used for every other telemetry. But there's an exception. By default, `TelemetryConfiguration` isn't fully set up when you log from *Program.cs* or *Startup.cs*. Logs from these places don't have the default configuration, so they aren't running all `TelemetryInitializer` instances and `TelemetryProcessor` instances.
         
      - question: I'm using the standalone package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights, and I want to log more custom telemetry manually. How should I do that?
        answer: |
          When you use the standalone package, `TelemetryClient` isn't injected to the dependency injection (DI) container. You need to create a new instance of `TelemetryClient` and use the same configuration that the logger provider uses, as the following code shows. This requirement ensures that the same configuration is used for all custom telemetry and telemetry from `ILogger`.

          ```csharp
          public class MyController : ApiController
          {
             // This TelemetryClient instance can be used to track additional telemetry through the TrackXXX() API.
             private readonly TelemetryClient _telemetryClient;
             private readonly ILogger _logger;

             public MyController(IOptions<TelemetryConfiguration> options, ILogger<MyController> logger)
             {
                  _telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(options.Value);
                  _logger = logger;
             }  
          }
          ```

          > [!NOTE]
          > If you use the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` package to enable Application Insights, modify this code to get `TelemetryClient` directly in the constructor.

      - question: I don't have the SDK installed, and I use the Azure Web Apps extension to enable Application Insights for my ASP.NET Core applications. How do I use the new provider? 
        answer: |
          The Application Insights extension in Azure Web Apps uses the new provider. You can modify the filtering rules in the *appsettings.json* file for your application.
       
  - name: Java Profiler
    questions:
      - question: What is Azure Monitor Application Insights Java Profiling?
        answer: |     
          The Java Profiler uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using  a customized configuration.

      - question: What is Java Flight Recorder?
        answer: |
          Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a tool for collecting profiling data of a running Java application. JFR is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is used for troubleshooting performance issues. Learn more about [Java SE JFR Runtime](https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/about.htm#JFRUH170).

      - question: What is the price and/or licensing fee implications for enabling App Insights Java Profiling?
        answer: | 
          Java Profiling is a free feature with Application Insights. [Azure Monitor Application Insights pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) is based on ingestion cost.

      - question: Which Java profiling information is collected? 
        answer: |
          Profiling data collected by the JFR includes: method and execution profiling data, garbage collection data, and lock profiles.

      - question: How can I use App Insights Java Profiling and visualize the data?
        answer:  |
          JFR recording can be viewed and analyzed with your preferred tool, for example [Java Mission Control (JMC)](https://jdk.java.net/jmc/8/).

      - question: Are performance diagnosis and fix recommendations provided with App Insights Java Profiling?
        answer: | 
          'Performance diagnostics and recommendations' is a new feature that is available soon as Application Insights Java Diagnostics. You can [sign up](https://aka.ms/JavaO11y) to preview this feature. JFR recording can be viewed with Java Mission Control (JMC).
          
      - question: What's the difference between on-demand and automatic Java Profiling in App Insights?
        answer: | 
          On-demand is user triggered profiling in real-time whereas automatic profiling is with preconfigured triggers.

          Use [Profile Now](../profiler/profiler-settings.md) for the on-demand profiling option. [Profile Now](../profiler/profiler-settings.md) immediately profiles all agents that are attached to the Application Insights instance.

          Automated profiling is triggered by reaching a resource threshold.

      - question: Which Java profiling triggers can I configure?
        answer: |
          Application Insights Java Agent currently supports monitoring of CPU and memory consumption. CPU threshold is configured as a percentage of all available cores on the machine. Memory is the current Tenured memory region (OldGen) occupancy against the maximum possible size of the region.

      - question: What are the required prerequisites to enable Java Profiling?
        answer: |
          Review the [Prerequisites](java-standalone-profiler.md#prerequisites).

      - question: Can I use Java Profiling for a microservices application?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can profile a JVM running microservices using the JFR.

  - name: Sampling overrides - Application Insights for Java       
    questions:
      - question: Do I need to use manual instrumentation to enable Sampling Overrides?
        answer: | 
          No, Sampling Overrides is now generally available (GA) and can be used with both autoinstrumentation and manual instrumentation.

      - question: How do I configure Sampling Overrides when using Azure App Service with autoinstrumentation?
        answer: |
          If you use autoinstrumentation, update the `applicationinsights.json` file in the Azure portal.

      - question: Is it necessary to manually upload the Application Insights agent file for Sampling Overrides?
        answer: |
          For autoinstrumentation, no manual agent upload is required. However, for manual instrumentation, you still need to include the Application Insights agent JAR file and configuration files in your deployment package.

      - question: What is the difference between "local development" and "application server" in the context of manual instrumentation?
        answer: |
          Local development refers to the environment where the app is being built or tested, such as a developer's machine or an Azure Cloud Shell instance. Application server refers to the web server running the application, such as Tomcat 11 in an Azure App Service environment. When using manual instrumentation, you must ensure that the agent JAR file is correctly placed on the application server.

      - question: If I'm using an Azure App Service with a Java runtime (for example, Tomcat 11), how do I configure Sampling Overrides?
        answer: |
          For autoinstrumentation, you can configure Sampling Overrides via the Azure portal. If using manual instrumentation, you should place the Application Insights agent JAR in the appropriate directory and include the applicationinsights.json file with your desired sampling settings.
        
  - name: Telemetry processors
    questions:
      - question: Why doesn't the log processor process log files using TelemetryClient.trackTrace()?
        answer: |
          TelemetryClient.trackTrace() is part of the Application Insights Classic SDK bridge, and the log processors only work with the new [OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation](opentelemetry-enable.md).

  - name: JavaScript SDK
    questions: 
      - question: What are the user and session counts?
        answer: |
          * The JavaScript SDK sets a user cookie on the web client, to identify returning users, and a session cookie to group activities.
          * If there's no client-side script, you can [set cookies at the server](https://apmtips.com/posts/2016-07-09-tracking-users-in-api-apps/).
          * If one real user uses your site in different browsers, or by using in-private/incognito browsing, or different machines, they're counted more than once.
          * To identify a signed-in user across machines and browsers, add a call to [setAuthenticatedUserContext()](./api-custom-events-metrics.md#authenticated-users).

      - question: What is the JavaScript SDK performance/overhead?
        answer: |
          The Application Insights JavaScript SDK has a minimal overhead on your website. At just 36 KB gzipped, and taking only ~15 ms to initialize, the SDK adds a negligible amount of load time to your website. The minimal components of the library are quickly loaded when you use the SDK, and the full script is downloaded in the background.

          Additionally, while the script is downloading from the CDN, all tracking of your page is queued, so you don't lose any telemetry during the entire life cycle of your page. This setup process provides your page with a seamless analytics system that's invisible to your users.

      - question: What browsers are supported by the JavaScript SDK?
        answer: |

      - question: Where can I find code examples for the JavaScript SDK?
        answer: | 
          For runnable examples, see [Application Insights JavaScript SDK samples](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/tree/master/examples).

      - question: What is the ES3/Internet Explorer 8 compatibility with the JavaScript SDK?
        answer: |
          We need to take necessary measures to ensure that this SDK continues to "work" and doesn't break the JavaScript execution when loaded by an older browser. It would be ideal to not support older browsers, but numerous large customers can't control which browser their users choose to use.

          This statement doesn't mean that we only support the lowest common set of features. We need to maintain ES3 code compatibility. New features need to be added in a manner that wouldn't break ES3 JavaScript parsing and added as an optional feature.

          See GitHub for full details on [Internet Explorer 8 support](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS#es3ie8-compatibility).
      
      - question: Is the JavaScript SDK open-source?
        answer: |    
          Yes, the Application Insights JavaScript SDK is open source. To view the source code or to contribute to the project, see the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS).     

  - name: JavaScript SDK configuration
    questions:
      - question: How can I update my third-party server configuration for the JavaScript SDK?
        answer: |
          The server side needs to be able to accept connections with those headers present. Depending on the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` configuration on the server side, it's often necessary to extend the server-side list by manually adding `Request-Id`, `Request-Context`, and `traceparent` (W3C distributed header).

          Access-Control-Allow-Headers: `Request-Id`, `traceparent`, `Request-Context`, `<your header>`

      - question: How can I disable distributed tracing for the JavaScript SDK?
        answer: |
          Distributed tracing can be disabled in configuration.

      - question: Are the HTTP 502 and 503 responses always captured by Application Insights?
        answer:  |
          No. The "502 bad gateway" and "503 service unavailable" errors aren't always captured by Application Insights. If only client-side JavaScript is being used for monitoring, this behavior would be expected because the error response is returned prior to the page containing the HTML header with the monitoring JavaScript snippet being rendered.
          
          If the 502 or 503 response was sent from a server with server-side monitoring enabled, the errors are collected by the Application Insights SDK.
          
          Even when server-side monitoring is enabled on an application's web server, sometimes a 502 or 503 error isn't captured by Application Insights. Many modern web servers don't allow a client to communicate directly. Instead, they employ solutions like reverse proxies to pass information back and forth between the client and the front-end web servers.
          
          In this scenario, a 502 or 503 response might be returned to a client because of an issue at the reverse proxy layer, so it isn't captured out-of-box by Application Insights. To help detect issues at this layer, you might need to forward logs from your reverse proxy to Log Analytics and create a custom rule to check for 502 or 503 responses. To learn more about common causes of 502 and 503 errors, see [Troubleshoot HTTP errors of "502 bad gateway" and "503 service unavailable" in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-http-502-http-503).
                
         
  - name: JavaScript framework extenstions 
    questions:
      - question: How does Application Insights generate device information like browser, OS, language, and model?
        answer: |
          The browser passes the User Agent string in the HTTP header of the request. The Application Insights ingestion service uses [UA Parser](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) to generate the fields you see in the data tables and experiences. As a result, Application Insights users are unable to change these fields.
          
          Occasionally, this data might be missing or inaccurate if the user or enterprise disables sending User Agent in browser settings. The [UA Parser regexes](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/blob/master/regexes.yaml) might not include all device information. Or Application Insights might not have adopted the latest updates.
