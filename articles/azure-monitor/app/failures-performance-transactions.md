# Investigate failures, performance, and transactions with Application Insights

[Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) collects telemetry from your application to help diagnosing failures and investigating slow transactions. It includes four essential tools:

* **Failures** - Tracks errors, exceptions, and faults, offering clear insights for fast problem-solving and enhanced stability.

* **Performance** - Quickly identifies and helps resolve application bottlenecks by displaying response times and operation counts.

* **Transaction search** - Enables users to locate and examine individual telemetry items such as page views, exceptions, and custom events.

* **Transaction diagnostics** - Helps to quickly identify issues in components through comprehensive insight into end-to-end transaction details.

Together, these tools ensure the ongoing health and efficiency of web applications. You can use them to pinpoint issues or enhancements that would have the most impact on users.

### [Failures view](#tab/failures-view)

To get to the **Failures** view in Application Insights, select either the **Failed requests** graph on the **Overview** pane, or **Failures** under the **Investigate** category in the resource menu.

You can also get to the failures view from the [Application Map](app-map.md) by selecting a resource, then **Investigate failures** from the triage section.

### [Performance view](#tab/performance-view)

To get to the **Performance** view in Application Insights, select either the **Server response time** or **Server requests** graph on the **Overview** pane, or **Performance** under the **Investigate** category in the resource menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view-go-to.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view-go-to.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to reach the 'Performance' view in Application Insights.":::

You can also get to the performance view from the [Application Map](app-map.md) by selecting a resource, then **Investigate performance** from the triage section.

### [Transaction search](#tab/transaction-search)

To get to the **Transaction search** view in Application Insights, select either **Search** from the command bar on the **Overview** pane, or **Transaction search** under the **Investigate** category in the resource menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-go-to.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-go-to.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to reach the 'Transaction search' view in Application Insights.":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can access **Transaction diagnostics** through any of the other three experiences. For more information, see [Investigate telemetry](#investigate-telemetry).

## Overview

### [Failures view](#tab/failures-view)

The **Failures** view shows a list of all failed operations collected for your application with the option to drill into each one. It lets you view their frequency and the number of users affected, to help you focus your efforts on the issues with the highest impact.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/failures-view.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/failures-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Failures' view in Application Insights.":::

### [Performance view](#tab/performance-view)

The **Performance** view shows a list of all operations collected for your application with the option to drill into each one. It lets you view their count and average duration, to help you focus your efforts on the issues with the highest impact.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Performance' view in Application Insights.":::

### [Transaction search](#tab/transaction-search)

**Transaction search** allows you to find and explore individual telemetry items.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Transaction search' view in Application Insights.":::

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the out-of-the-box telemetry sent by the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro or JavaScript SDK, you can add and modify telemetry (for example, custom events).
>
> For more information, see [Add and modify Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry for .NET, Java, Node.js, and Python applications](opentelemetry-add-modify.md).

## Filter telemetry

### Default filters

All experiences allow you to filter telemetry by time range. In addition, each experience comes with its own default filter:

### [Failures view](#tab/failures-view)

You can select which service (Cloud Role Name) or machine/container (Cloud Role Instance) to view from the **Roles** filter menu. This action allows you to isolate issues or performance trends within specific parts of your application.

To learn how to set the *Cloud Role Name* and the *Cloud Role Instance*, see [Configure Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry-configuration.md#set-the-cloud-role-name-and-the-cloud-role-instance).

### [Performance view](#tab/performance-view)

You can select which service (Cloud Role Name) or machine/container (Cloud Role Instance) to view from the **Roles** filter menu. This action allows you to isolate issues or performance trends within specific parts of your application.

To learn how to set the *Cloud Role Name* and the *Cloud Role Instance*, see [Configure Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry-configuration.md#set-the-cloud-role-name-and-the-cloud-role-instance).

### [Transaction search](#tab/transaction-search)

You can select which event types to view from the **Event types** dropdown menu, including:

* **Availability** - Results from [availability tests](availability-overview.md), used to monitor uptime and responsiveness from different locations around the globe.

* **Custom Event** - Custom events set up and captured using the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](opentelemetry-add-modify.md#send-custom-events) or the [JavaScript SDK](javascript-sdk.md).

* **Dependency** - Outbound calls from your application to external services such as REST APIs, databases, or message queues.

* **Exception** - Captured exceptions, including server-side errors and exceptions explicitly recorded using `TrackException()`.

* **Page View** - [Telemetry sent by the web client](javascript-sdk.md) to create page view reports.

* **Request** - HTTP requests to your server application, including API calls, web pages, and assets. These events are used to create the request and response overview charts.

* **Trace** - Diagnostic log data captured through logging frameworks included in the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](opentelemetry-add-modify.md#included-instrumentation-libraries).

If you want to restore the filters later, select **Reset** from the top navigation bar.

### Add filters

You can filter events on the values of their properties. The available properties depend on the event or telemetry types you selected. To add a filter:

1. Select :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-filter-icon.png" alt-text="Filter icon" border="false"::: to add a filter.

    :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/filter-selection.png" alt-text="Filter pill" border="false":::

1. From the left dropdown list, select a property.

1. From the center dropdown list, select one of the following operators: `=`, `!=`, `contains`, or `not contains`.

1. From the right dropdown list, select all property values you want to filter on.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice that the counts to the right of the filter values show how many occurrences there are in the current filtered set.

1. To add another filter, select :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-filter-icon.png" alt-text="Filter icon" border="false"::: again.

## Search telemetry

### [Failures view](#tab/failures-view)

You can search for specific operations using the **Search to filter items...** field above the operations list.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/failures-view-search.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/failures-view-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Search' field.":::

### [Performance view](#tab/performance-view)

You can search for specific operations using the **Search to filter items...** field above the operations list.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view-search.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Search' field.":::

### [Transaction search](#tab/transaction-search)

You can search for terms in any of the property values. This capability is useful if you write [custom events](api-custom-events-metrics.md) with property values.

> [!TIP]
> You might want to set a time range because searches over a shorter range are faster.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-property.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-property.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows opening a diagnostic search.":::

Search for complete words, not substrings. Use quotation marks to enclose special characters.

| String               | *Not* found                       | Found                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HomeController.About | `home`<br/>`controller`<br/>`out` | `homecontroller`<br/>`about`<br/>`"homecontroller.about"`           |
| United States        | `Uni`<br/>`ted`                   | `united`<br/>`states`<br/>`united AND states`<br/>`"united states"` |

You can use the following search expressions:

| Sample query                           | Effect                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `apple`                                | Find all events in the time range whose fields include the word `apple`.            |
| `apple AND banana` <br/>`apple banana` | Find events that contain both words. Use capital `AND`, not `and`. <br/>Short form. |
| `apple OR banana`                      | Find events that contain either word. Use `OR`, not `or`.                           |
| `apple NOT banana`                     | Find events that contain one word but not the other.                                |

> [!NOTE]
> If your app generates significant telemetry and uses ASP.NET SDK version 2.0.0-beta3 or later, it automatically reduces the volume sent to the portal through adaptive sampling. This module sends only a representative fraction of events. It selects or deselects events related to the same request as a group, allowing you to navigate between related events.
>
> Learn about [sampling](sampling.md).

---

### Use analytics data

All data collected by Application Insights is stored in [Log Analytics](../logs/log-analytics-overview.md). It provides a rich query language to analyze the requests that generated the exception you're investigating.

> [!TIP]
> [Simple mode](../logs/log-analytics-simple-mode.md) in Log Analytics offers an intuitive point-and-click interface for analyzing and visualizing log data.

1. On either the performance, failures, or transaction search view, select **View in Logs** in the top navigation bar and pick a query from the dropdown menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/logs-view-go-to.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/logs-view-go-to.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the top action bar with the 'View in logs' button highlighted.":::

1. This action takes you to the **Logs** view, where you can further modify the query or select a different one from the sidebar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/logs-view.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/logs-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Logs' view.":::

## Investigate telemetry

### [Failures view](#tab/failures-view)

To investigate the root cause of an error or exception, you can drill into the problematic operation for a detailed end-to-end transaction details view that includes dependencies and exception details.

1. Select an operation to view the **Top 3 response codes**, **Top 3 exception types**, and **Top 3 failed dependencies** for that operation.

1. Under **Drill into**, select the button with the number of filtered results to view a list of sample operations.

1. Select a sample operation to open the **End-to-end transaction details** view.

	:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/failures-view-drill-into.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/failures-view-drill-into.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Failures' view with the 'Drill into' button highlighted.":::

	> [!NOTE]
	> The **Suggested** samples contain related telemetry from all components, even if sampling is in effect in any of them.

### [Performance view](#tab/performance-view)

To investigate the root cause of a performance issue, you can drill into the problematic operation for a detailed end-to-end transaction details view that includes dependencies and exception details.

1. Select an operation to view the **Distribution of durations** for different requests of that operation, and other **Insights**.

1. Under **Drill into**, select the button with the number of filtered results to view a list of sample operations.

1. Select a sample operation to open the **End-to-end transaction details** view.

	:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view-drill-into.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/performance-view-drill-into.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Performance' view with the 'Drill into' button highlighted.":::

	> [!NOTE]
	> The **Suggested** samples contain related telemetry from all components, even if sampling is in effect in any of them.

### [Transaction search](#tab/transaction-search)

To investigate an event further, select any telemetry item to open the **End-to-end transaction details** view.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-telemetry-item.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-search-telemetry-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an individual dependency request.":::

### Analyze client-side performance and failures

If you instrument your web pages with Application Insights, you can gain visibility into page views, browser operations, and dependencies. Collecting this browser data requires [adding a script to your web pages](javascript-sdk.md#add-the-javascript-code).

1. After you add the script, you can access page views and their associated performance metrics by selecting the **Browser** toggle on the **Performance** or **Failures** view.

    :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/server-browser-toggle.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/server-browser-toggle.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the 'Server / Browser' toggle below the top action bar.":::

    This view provides a visual summary of various telemetries of your application from the perspective of the browser.

1. For browser operations, the [end-to-end transaction details](#transaction-diagnostics) view shows **Page View Properties** of the client requesting the page, including the type of browser and its location. This information can help determining whether there are performance issues related to particular types of clients.

    :::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-page-view-properties.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-page-view-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'End-to-end transaction details' view with the 'Page View Properties' section highlighted.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Like the data collected for server performance, Application Insights makes all client data available for deep analysis by using logs.

## Transaction diagnostics experience

The **Transaction diagnostics** experience, also called **End-to-end transaction details** view, shows a Gantt chart of the transaction, which lists all events with their duration and response code. 

This diagnostics experience automatically correlates server-side telemetry from across all your Application Insights monitored components into a single view and supports multiple resources. Application Insights detects the underlying relationship and allows you to easily diagnose the application component, dependency, or exception that caused a transaction slowdown or failure.

Selecting a specific event reveals its properties, including additional information like the underlying command or call stack.

This view has four key parts:

#### [Results list](#tab/results-list)

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-results-list.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-results-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the transaction view with the results list highlighted.":::

This collapsible pane shows the other results that meet the filter criteria. Select any result to update the respective details of the preceding three sections. We try to find samples that are most likely to have the details available from all components, even if sampling is in effect in any of them. These samples are shown as suggestions.

#### [Transaction chart](#tab/transaction-chart)

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-transaction-chart.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-transaction-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the transaction view with the cross-component transaction chart highlighted.":::

This chart provides a timeline with horizontal bars during requests and dependencies across components. Any exceptions that are collected are also marked on the timeline.

* The top row on this chart represents the entry point. It's the incoming request to the first component called in this transaction. The duration is the total time taken for the transaction to complete.
* Any calls to external dependencies are simple noncollapsible rows, with icons that represent the dependency type.
* Calls to other components are collapsible rows. Each row corresponds to a specific operation invoked at the component.
* By default, the request, dependency, or exception that you selected appears to the side. To see its [details](/azure/azure-monitor/app/failures-performance-transactions?tabs=details#transaction-diagnostics-experience), select any row.

> [!NOTE]
> Calls to other components have two rows. One row represents the outbound call (dependency) from the caller component. The other row corresponds to the inbound request at the called component. The leading icon and distinct styling of the duration bars help differentiate between them.

#### [Time-sequence list](#tab/time-sequence-list)

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-time-sequence-collapsed.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-time-sequence-collapsed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the transaction view with the collapsed time sequence section highlighted.":::

This section shows a flat list view in a time sequence of all the telemetry related to this transaction. It also shows the custom events and traces that aren't displayed in the transaction chart. You can filter this list to telemetry generated by a specific component or call. You can select any telemetry item in this list to see corresponding [details on the side](/azure/azure-monitor/app/failures-performance-transactions?tabs=details#transaction-diagnostics-experience).

**Expanded:**

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-time-sequence-expanded.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-time-sequence-expanded.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the transaction view with the expanded time sequence section highlighted.":::

#### [Details](#tab/details)

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-details.png" lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/transaction-view-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the transaction view with the details section highlighted.":::

This collapsible pane shows the detail of any selected item from the transaction chart or the list. **Show all** lists all the standard attributes that are collected. Any custom attributes are listed separately under the standard set. Select the ellipsis button (...) under the **Call Stack** trace window to get an option to copy the trace. **Open profiler traces** and **Open debug snapshot** show code-level diagnostics in corresponding detail panes.

---

## Release annotations

Release annotations mark deployments and other significant events on Application Insights charts, allowing correlation of changes with performance, failures, and usage.

### Automatic annotations with Azure Pipelines

[Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines) creates a release annotation during deployment when all the following conditions are true:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - The target resource links to Application Insights through the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` app setting.
> - The Application Insights resource is in the same subscription as the target resource.
> - The deployment uses one of the following Azure Pipelines tasks:

  | Task code                 | Task name                     | Versions     |
  |---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
  | AzureAppServiceSettings   | Azure App Service Settings    | Any          |
  | AzureRmWebAppDeployment   | Azure App Service             | V3+          |
  | AzureFunctionApp          | Azure Functions               | Any          |
  | AzureFunctionAppContainer | Azure Functions for container | Any          |
  | AzureWebAppContainer      | Azure Web App for Containers  | Any          |
  | AzureWebApp               | Azure Web App                 | Any          |

> [!NOTE]
> If you still use the older Application Insights annotation deployment task, delete it.

### Configure annotations in a pipeline by using an inline script

If you don't use the tasks in the previous section, add an inline script in the deployment stage.

1. Open an existing pipeline or create a new one, and select a task under **Stages**.
1. Add a new **Azure CLI** task.
1. Select the Azure subscription. Set **Script Type** to **PowerShell**, and set **Script Location** to **Inline**.
1. Add the PowerShell script from step 2 in [Create release annotations with the Azure CLI](#create-release-annotations-with-the-azure-cli) to **Inline Script**.
1. Add script arguments. Replace placeholders in angle brackets.

   ```powershell
   -aiResourceId "<aiResourceId>" `
   -releaseName "<releaseName>" `
   -releaseProperties @{"ReleaseDescription"="<a description>";
        "TriggerBy"="<Your name>" }
   ```

   The following example shows metadata you can set in the optional `releaseProperties` argument by using build and release variables. Select **Save**.

   ```powershell
   -releaseProperties @{
    "BuildNumber"="$(Build.BuildNumber)";
    "BuildRepositoryName"="$(Build.Repository.Name)";
    "BuildRepositoryProvider"="$(Build.Repository.Provider)";
    "ReleaseDefinitionName"="$(Build.DefinitionName)";
    "ReleaseDescription"="Triggered by $(Build.DefinitionName) $(Build.BuildNumber)";
    "ReleaseEnvironmentName"="$(Release.EnvironmentName)";
    "ReleaseId"="$(Release.ReleaseId)";
    "ReleaseName"="$(Release.ReleaseName)";
    "ReleaseRequestedFor"="$(Release.RequestedFor)";
    "ReleaseWebUrl"="$(Release.ReleaseWebUrl)";
    "SourceBranch"="$(Build.SourceBranch)";
    "TeamFoundationCollectionUri"="$(System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri)" }
   ```

### Create release annotations with the Azure CLI

Use the following PowerShell script to create a release annotation from any process, without Azure DevOps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
1. Save the following script as `CreateReleaseAnnotation.ps1`.

   ```powershell
   param(
       [parameter(Mandatory = $true)][string]$aiResourceId,
       [parameter(Mandatory = $true)][string]$releaseName,
       [parameter(Mandatory = $false)]$releaseProperties = @()
   )

   # Function to ensure all Unicode characters in a JSON string are properly escaped
   function Convert-UnicodeToEscapeHex {
     param (
       [parameter(Mandatory = $true)][string]$JsonString
     )
     $JsonObject = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $JsonString
     foreach ($property in $JsonObject.PSObject.Properties) {
       $name = $property.Name
       $value = $property.Value
       if ($value -is [string]) {
         $value = [regex]::Unescape($value)
         $OutputString = ""
         foreach ($char in $value.ToCharArray()) {
           $dec = [int]$char
           if ($dec -gt 127) {
             $hex = [convert]::ToString($dec, 16)
             $hex = $hex.PadLeft(4, '0')
             $OutputString += "\u$hex"
           }
           else {
             $OutputString += $char
           }
         }
         $JsonObject.$name = $OutputString
       }
     }
     return ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $JsonObject -Compress
   }
   
   $annotation = @{
       Id = [GUID]::NewGuid();
       AnnotationName = $releaseName;
       EventTime = (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().GetDateTimeFormats("s")[0];
       Category = "Deployment"; #Application Insights only displays annotations from the "Deployment" Category
       Properties = ConvertTo-Json $releaseProperties -Compress
   }
   
   $annotation = ConvertTo-Json $annotation -Compress
   $annotation = Convert-UnicodeToEscapeHex -JsonString $annotation  
 
   $accessToken = (az account get-access-token | ConvertFrom-Json).accessToken
   $headers = @{
       "Authorization" = "Bearer $accessToken"
       "Accept"        = "application/json"
       "Content-Type"  = "application/json"
   }
   $params = @{
       Headers = $headers
       Method  = "Put"
       Uri     = "https://management.azure.com$($aiResourceId)/Annotations?api-version=2015-05-01"
       Body    = $annotation
   }
   Invoke-RestMethod @params
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Set **Category** to **Deployment** or annotations don't appear in the Azure portal.

Call the script and pass values for the parameters. The `-releaseProperties` parameter is optional.

```powershell
.\CreateReleaseAnnotation.ps1 `
 -aiResourceId "<aiResourceId>" `
 -releaseName "<releaseName>" `
 -releaseProperties @{"ReleaseDescription"="<a description>";
     "TriggerBy"="<Your name>" }
```

### View annotations

> [!NOTE]
> Release annotations aren't available in the **Metrics** pane.

Application Insights displays release annotations in the following experiences:

- [**Performance and Failures**](#investigate-failures-performance-and-transactions-with-application-insights)
- [**Usage**](usage.md)
- [**Workbooks**](../visualize/best-practices-visualize.md) (for any time-series visualization)

Annotations are visualized as markers at the top of charts.

:::image type="content" source="media/failures-performance-transactions/annotations.png" alt-text="A screenshot of an exceptions chart with annotations." lightbox="media/failures-performance-transactions/annotations.png":::

To enable annotations in a workbook, open **Advanced Settings** and then select **Show annotations**. Select any annotation marker to open release details such as requestor, source control branch, release pipeline, and environment.

## Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to common questions.

### Transaction search

<details>
<summary><b>What is a component?</b></summary>

Components are independently deployable parts of your distributed or microservice application. Developers and operations teams have code-level visibility or access to telemetry generated by these application components.

* Components are different from "observed" external dependencies, such as SQL and event hubs, which your team or organization might not have access to (code or telemetry).
* Components run on any number of server, role, or container instances.
* Components can be separate Application Insights instrumentation keys, even if subscriptions are different. Components also can be different roles that report to a single Application Insights instrumentation key. The new experience shows details across all components, regardless of how they were set up.

We don't log the POST data automatically, but you can use [TrackTrace or log calls](asp-net-trace-logs.md). Put the POST data in the message parameter. You can't filter on the message in the same way you can filter on properties, but the size limit is longer.

#### What is a component?

Components are independently deployable parts of your distributed or microservice application. Developers and operations teams have code-level visibility or access to telemetry generated by these application components.

* Components are different from "observed" external dependencies, such as SQL and event hubs, which your team or organization might not have access to (code or telemetry).
* Components run on any number of server, role, or container instances.
* Components can be separate Application Insights instrumentation keys, even if subscriptions are different. Components also can be different roles that report to a single Application Insights instrumentation key. The new experience shows details across all components, regardless of how they were set up.

#### How much data is retained?

See the [Limits summary](../service-limits.md#application-insights).

### Transaction diagnostics

<details>
<summary><b>Why do I see a single component on the chart and the other components only show as external dependencies without any details?</b></summary>

Potential reasons:

* Are the other components instrumented with Application Insights?
* Are they using the latest stable Application Insights SDK?
* If these components are separate Application Insights resources, validate you have [access](../roles-permissions-security.md).
If you do have access and the components are instrumented with the latest Application Insights Software Development Kits (SDKs), let us know via the feedback channel in the upper-right corner.

<details>
<summary><b>I see duplicate rows for the dependencies. Is this behavior expected?</b></summary>

Currently, we're showing the outbound dependency call separate from the inbound request. Typically, the two calls look identical with only the duration value being different because of the network round trip. The leading icon and distinct styling of the duration bars help differentiate between them. Is this presentation of the data confusing? Give us your feedback!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What about clock skews across different component instances?</b></summary>

Timelines are adjusted for clock skews in the transaction chart. You can see the exact timestamps in the details pane or by using Log Analytics.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is the new experience missing most of the related items queries?</b></summary>

This behavior is by design. All the related items, across all components, are already available on the left side in the top and bottom sections. The new experience has two related items that the left side doesn't cover: all telemetry from five minutes before and after this event and the user timeline.

<details>
<summary><b>Is there a way to see fewer events per transaction when I use the Application Insights JavaScript SDK?</b></summary>

The transaction diagnostics experience shows all telemetry in a [single operation](distributed-trace-data.md#data-model-for-telemetry-correlation) that shares an [Operation ID](data-model-complete.md#context). By default, the Application Insights SDK for JavaScript creates a new operation for each unique page view. In a single-page application (SPA), only one page view event is created and a single Operation ID is used for all telemetry generated. As a result, many events might be correlated to the same operation.

In these scenarios, you can use Automatic Route Tracking to automatically create new operations for navigation in your SPA. You must turn on [enableAutoRouteTracking](javascript.md#single-page-applications) so that the system creates a page view each time the URL route is updated (logical page view occurs). If you want to manually refresh the Operation ID, call `appInsights.properties.context.telemetryTrace.traceID = Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Telemetry.Util.generateW3CId()`. Manually triggering a PageView event also resets the Operation ID.

<details>
<summary><b>Why do transaction detail durations not add up to the top-request duration?</b></summary>

Time not explained in the Gantt chart is time that isn't covered by a tracked dependency. This issue can occur because external calls weren't instrumented, either automatically or manually. It can also occur because the time taken was in process rather than because of an external call.

If all calls were instrumented, in process is the likely root cause for the time spent. A useful tool for diagnosing the process is the [.NET Profiler](profiler-overview.md).

<summary><b>What if I see the message "Error retrieving data" while navigating Application Insights in the Azure portal?</b></summary>

This error indicates that the browser was unable to call into a required API or the API returned a failure response. To troubleshoot the behavior, open a browser [InPrivate window](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/browse-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge-cd2c9a48-0bc4-b98e-5e46-ac40c84e27e2) and [disable any browser extensions](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/add-turn-off-or-remove-extensions-in-microsoft-edge-9c0ec68c-2fbc-2f2c-9ff0-bdc76f46b026) that are running, then identify if you can still reproduce the portal behavior. If the portal error still occurs, try testing with other browsers, or other machines, investigate Domain Name System (DNS) or other network related issues from the client machine where the API calls are failing. If the portal error continues, [collect a browser network trace](/azure/azure-portal/capture-browser-trace#capture-a-browser-trace-for-troubleshooting) while reproducing the unexpected behavior. Then open a support case from the Azure portal.
