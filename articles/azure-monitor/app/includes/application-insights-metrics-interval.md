> [!TIP]
> Azure Monitor Metrics and Azure Monitor Workspace ingest custom metrics at a fixed 60-second interval. Metrics sent more frequently are buffered and processed once every 60 seconds. Log Analytics records metrics at the interval theyâ€™re sent, which can increase cost at shorter intervals and delay visibility at longer ones.
