> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](../opentelemetry-enable.md#enable-azure-monitor-opentelemetry-for-net-nodejs-python-and-java-applications) for new applications or customers to power [Azure Monitor Application Insights](../app-insights-overview.md). The Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro delivers a similar functionality and experience as the Application Insights SDK. It's possible to migrate from the Application Insights SDK using the migration guides for [.NET](../opentelemetry-dotnet-migrate.md), [Node.js](../opentelemetry-nodejs-migrate.md), and [Python](../opentelemetry-python-opencensus-migrate.md), but we are still working to add a [few more features](../application-insights-faq.yml#what-s-the-current-release-state-of-features-within-the-azure-monitor-opentelemetry-distro) for backwards compatibility.
