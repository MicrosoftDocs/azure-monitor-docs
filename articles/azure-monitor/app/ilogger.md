# Application Insights logging with .NET

In this article, you learn how to capture logs with Application Insights in .NET apps by using the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights`][nuget-ai] provider package. If you use this provider, you can query and analyze your logs by using the Application Insights tools.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-app-insights-otel-available-notification](includes/azure-monitor-app-insights-otel-available-notification.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to implement the full range of Application Insights telemetry along with logging, see [Configure Application Insights for your ASP.NET websites](./asp-net.md) or [Application Insights for ASP.NET Core applications](./asp-net-core.md).

> [!TIP]
> The [`Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService`][nuget-ai-ws] NuGet package, used to enable Application Insights for background services, is out of scope. For more information, see [Application Insights for Worker Service apps](./worker-service.md).

## ASP.NET Core applications

To add Application Insights logging to ASP.NET Core applications:

1. Install the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights`][nuget-ai].

1. Add `ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.

builder.Services.AddControllers();
// Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

builder.Logging.AddApplicationInsights(
        configureTelemetryConfiguration: (config) => 
            config.ConnectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"),
            configureApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions: (options) => { }
    );

builder.Logging.AddFilter<ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("your-category", LogLevel.Trace);

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

With the NuGet package installed and the provider being registered with dependency injection, the app is ready to log. With constructor injection, either <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> or the generic-type alternative <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger%601> is required. When these implementations are resolved, `ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider` provides them. Logged messages or exceptions are sent to Application Insights. 

Consider the following example controller:

```csharp
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public ValuesController(ILogger<ValuesController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult<IEnumerable<string>> Get()
    {
        _logger.LogWarning("An example of a Warning trace..");
        _logger.LogError("An example of an Error level message");

        return new string[] { "value1", "value2" };
    }
}
```

Where can I see ILogger logs in Application Insights?](application-insights-faq.yml#what-application-insights-telemetry-type-is-produced-from-ilogger-logs-where-can-i-see-ilogger-logs-in-application-insights).

## Console application

To add Application Insights logging to console applications, first install the following NuGet packages:

* [`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights`][nuget-ai]
* [`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)

The following example uses the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights package and demonstrates the default behavior for a console application. The Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights package should be used in a console application or whenever you want a bare minimum implementation of Application Insights without the full feature set such as metrics, distributed tracing, sampling, and telemetry initializers.

```csharp
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

using var channel = new InMemoryChannel();

try
{
    IServiceCollection services = new ServiceCollection();
    services.Configure<TelemetryConfiguration>(config => config.TelemetryChannel = channel);
    services.AddLogging(builder =>
    {
        // Only Application Insights is registered as a logger provider
        builder.AddApplicationInsights(
            configureTelemetryConfiguration: (config) => config.ConnectionString = "<YourConnectionString>",
            configureApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions: (options) => { }
        );
    });

    IServiceProvider serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
    ILogger<Program> logger = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();

    logger.LogInformation("Logger is working...");
}
finally
{
    // Explicitly call Flush() followed by Delay, as required in console apps.
    // This ensures that even if the application terminates, telemetry is sent to the back end.
    channel.Flush();

    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
}
```

For more information, see [What Application Insights telemetry type is produced from ILogger logs? Where can I see ILogger logs in Application Insights?](application-insights-faq.yml#what-application-insights-telemetry-type-is-produced-from-ilogger-logs-where-can-i-see-ilogger-logs-in-application-insights).

## Logging scopes

`ApplicationInsightsLoggingProvider` supports [log scopes](/dotnet/core/extensions/logging#log-scopes). Scopes are enabled by default. 

If the scope is of type `IReadOnlyCollection<KeyValuePair<string,object>>`, then each key/value pair in the collection is added to the Application Insights telemetry as custom properties. In the following example, logs are captured as `TraceTelemetry` and has `("MyKey", "MyValue")` in properties.

```csharp
using (_logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { ["MyKey"] = "MyValue" }))
{
    _logger.LogError("An example of an Error level message");
}
```

If any other type is used as a scope, it gets stored under the property `Scope` in Application Insights telemetry. In the following example, `TraceTelemetry` has a property called `Scope` that contains the scope.

```csharp
using (_logger.BeginScope("hello scope"))
{
    _logger.LogError("An example of an Error level message");
}
```
