# Use autoscale actions to send email and webhook alert notifications in Azure Monitor
This article shows you how to set up notifications so that you can call specific web URLs or send emails based on autoscale actions in Azure.

## Webhooks
Webhooks allow you to send HTTP requests to a specific URL endpoint (callback URL) when a certain event or trigger occurs. Using webhooks, you can automate and streamline processes by enabling the automatic exchange of information between different systems or applications. Use webhooks to trigger custom code, notifications, or other actions to run when an autoscale event occurs.

## Email
You can send email to any valid email address when an autoscale event occurs.

> [!NOTE]    
> Starting April 3, 2024, you won't be able to add any new Co-Administrators for Azure Autoscale Notifications. Azure Classic administrators will be retired on August 31, 2024, and you would not be able to send Azure Autoscale Notifications using Administrators and Co-Administrators after August 31, 2024. For moe information, see [Prepare for Co-administrators retirement](/azure/role-based-access-control/classic-administrators?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring&tabs=azure-portal#prepare-for-co-administrators-retirement)


## Configure Notifications

Use the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, or Resource Manager templates to configure notifications.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

### Set up notifications using the Azure portal.

Select the **Notify** tab on the autoscale settings page to configure notifications.

Enter a list of email addresses to send notifications to.
  
Enter a webhook URI to send a notification to a web service. You can also add custom headers to the webhook request. For example, you can add an authentication token in the header, query parameters, or add a custom header to identify the source of the request.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

### Use CLI to configure notifications.

Use the `az monitor autoscale update` or the `az monitor autoscale create` command to configure notifications using Azure CLI.  

The following parameters are used to configure notifications:

+ `--add-action` - The action to take when the autoscale rule is triggered. The value must be `email` or `webhook`, and followed by the email address or webhook URI. 
+ `--remove-action` - Remove an action previously added by `--add-action`. The value must be `email` or `webhook`. The parameter is only relevant for the  `az monitor autoscale update` command.


For example, the following command adds an email notification and a webhook notification to and existing autoscale setting.

```azurecli
 az monitor autoscale update \
--resource-group <resource group name> \
--name <autoscale setting name> \
--add-action email pdavis@contoso.com \
--add-action webhook http://myservice.com/webhook-listerner-123
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can add mote than one email or webhook notification by using the `--add-action` parameter multiple times. While multiple webhook notifications are supported and can be seen in the JSON, the portal only shows the first webhook.


For more information, see [az monitor autoscale](/cli/azure/monitor/autoscale).



### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

### Use PowerShell to configure notifications. 

The following example shows how to configure a webhook and email notification.

1. Create the webhook object.

1. Create the notification object.
1. Add the notification object to the autoscale setting using `New-AzAutoscaleSetting` or `Update-AzAutoscaleSetting` cmdlets.

```powershell
# Assumining you have already created a profile object and have a vmssName, resourceGroup, and subscriptionId

 $webhook=New-AzAutoscaleWebhookNotificationObject  `
-Property @{"method"='GET'; "headers"= '"Authorization", "tokenvalue-12345678abcdef"'} `
-ServiceUri "http://myservice.com/webhook-listerner-123"

$notification=New-AzAutoscaleNotificationObject `
-EmailCustomEmail "pdavis@contoso.com" `
-Webhook $webhook


New-AzAutoscaleSetting -Name autoscalesetting2 `
-ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
-Location eastus `
-Profile $profile `
-Enabled -Notification $notification `
-PropertiesName "autoscalesetting" `
-TargetResourceUri "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/$vmssName"
```


### [Resource Manager](#tab/resourcemanager)

### Use Resource Manager templates to configure notifications.

When you use the Resource Manager templates or REST API, include the `notifications` element in your [autoscale settings](/azure/templates/microsoft.insights/autoscalesettings?pivots=deployment-language-arm-template#resource-format-1), for example:

```JSON
"notifications": [
      {
        "operation": "Scale",
        "email": {
          "sendToSubscriptionAdministrator": false,
          "sendToSubscriptionCoAdministrators": false,
          "customEmails": [
              "user1@mycompany.com",
              "user2@mycompany.com"
              ]
        },
        "webhooks": [
          {
            "serviceUri": "https://my.webhook.example.com?token=abcd1234",
            "properties": {
              "optional_key1": "optional_value1",
              "optional_key2": "optional_value2"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
```

| Field | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operation` |Yes |Value must be `Scale`. |
| `sendToSubscriptionAdministrator` |Yes |No longer supported. Value must be `false`. |
| `sendToSubscriptionCoAdministrators` |Yes |No longer supported. Value must be `false`.|
| `customEmails` |Yes |Value can be null [] or a string array of emails. |
| `webhooks` |Yes |Value can be null or valid URI. |
| `serviceUri` |Yes |Valid HTTPS URI. |
| `properties` |Yes |Value must be empty {} or can contain key-value pairs. |

## Authentication in webhooks
The webhook can authenticate by using token-based authentication, where you save the webhook URI with a token ID as a query parameter. For example,  `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=123-abc456-7890&myparameter2=value123`.

## Autoscale notification webhook payload schema
When the autoscale notification is generated, the following metadata is included in the webhook payload:

```JSON
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "status": "Activated",
    "operation": "Scale Out",
    "context": {
        "timestamp": "2023-06-22T07:01:47.8926726Z",

        "oldCapacity": "1",
        "newCapacity": "2"
    },
    "properties": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }   
}
```

| Field | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
