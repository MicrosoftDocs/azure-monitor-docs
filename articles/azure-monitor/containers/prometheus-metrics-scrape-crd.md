# Customize collection using CRDs (Service and Pod Monitors)


The enablement of Managed Prometheus automatically deploys the custom resource definitions (CRD) for [pod monitors](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/deploy/addon-chart/azure-monitor-metrics-addon/templates/ama-metrics-podmonitor-crd.yaml) and [service monitors](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/deploy/addon-chart/azure-monitor-metrics-addon/templates/ama-metrics-servicemonitor-crd.yaml). These custom resource definitions are the same custom resource definitions (CRD) as [OSS Pod monitors](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.PodMonitor) and [OSS service monitors](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.ServiceMonitor) for Prometheus, except for a change in the group name. If you have existing Prometheus CRDs and custom resources on your cluster, these CRDs won't conflict with the CRDs created by the add-on. At the same time, the managed Prometheus addon does not pick up the CRDs created for the OSS Prometheus. This separation is intentional for the purposes of isolation of scrape jobs.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for custom resources definitions (CRDs) in Azure ARC-enabled Kubernetes is currently not available.

## Create a Pod or Service Monitor

Use the [Pod and Service Monitor templates](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/tree/main/otelcollector/customresources) and follow the API specification to create your custom resources([PodMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#podmonitor) and [Service Monitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.ServiceMonitor)). **Note** that the only change required to the existing OSS CRs(Custom Resources) for being picked up by the Managed Prometheus is the API group - **azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1**.
>Note - Please make sure to use the **labelLimit, labelNameLengthLimit and labelValueLengthLimit** specified in the templates so that they are not dropped during processing.

Your pod and service monitors should look like the following examples:

### Example Pod Monitor

```yaml
# Note the API version is azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1 instead of monitoring.coreos.com/v1
apiVersion: azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor

# Can be deployed in any namespace
metadata:
  name: reference-app
  namespace: app-namespace
spec:
  labelLimit: 63
  labelNameLengthLimit: 511
  labelValueLengthLimit: 1023

  # The selector specifies which pods to filter for
  selector:

    # Filter by pod labels
    matchLabels:
      environment: test
    matchExpressions:
      - key: app
        operator: In
        values: [app-frontend, app-backend]

    # [Optional] Filter by pod namespace
    namespaceSelector:
      matchNames: [app-frontend, app-backend]

  # [Optional] Labels on the pod with these keys will be added as labels to each metric scraped
  podTargetLabels: [app, region, environment]

  # Multiple pod endpoints can be specified. Port requires a named port.
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - port: metrics
```

### Example Service Monitor

```yaml
# Note the API version is azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1 instead of monitoring.coreos.com/v1
apiVersion: azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor

# Can be deployed in any namespace
metadata:
  name: reference-app
  namespace: app-namespace
spec:
  labelLimit: 63
  labelNameLengthLimit: 511
  labelValueLengthLimit: 1023

  # The selector filters endpoints by service labels.
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reference-app

  # Multiple endpoints can be specified. Port requires a named port.
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
```

### Deploy a Pod or Service Monitor

You can then deploy the pod or service monitor using kubectl apply.

When applied, any errors in the custom resources should show up and the pod or service monitors should fail to apply.  
A successful pod monitor creation looks like the following -

```bash
podmonitor.azmonitoring.coreos.com/my-pod-monitor created
```

### Examples

#### Create a sample application

Deploy a sample application exposing prometheus metrics to be configured by pod/service monitor.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/internal/referenceapp/prometheus-reference-app.yaml
```

#### Create a pod monitor and/or service monitor to scrape metrics 

Deploy a pod monitor that is configured to scrape metrics from the example application from the previous step.

##### Pod Monitor

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/deploy/example-custom-resources/pod-monitor/pod-monitor-reference-app.yaml
```

##### Service Monitor

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/deploy/example-custom-resources/service-monitor/service-monitor-reference-app.yaml
```

### Troubleshooting

When the pod or service monitors are successfully applied, the addon should automatically start collecting metrics from the targets. To confirm this, follow the instructions [here](prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot.md#prometheus-interface) for general troubleshooting of custom resources and also to ensure the targets show up in 127.0.0.1/targets.
