# Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container insights

Use the workbooks, performance charts, and health status in Container insights to monitor the workload of Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Stack, or another environment. This article helps you understand how to use Azure Monitor to help you quickly assess, investigate, and resolve detected issues.

## Workbooks

Workbooks combine text,â€¯log queries, metrics, and parameters into rich interactive reports that you can use to analyze cluster performance. For a description of the workbooks available for Container insights and how to access them, see [Workbooks in Container insights](container-insights-reports.md). 


## Multi-cluster view from Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor provides a multi-cluster view that shows the health status of all monitored Kubernetes clusters deployed across resource groups in your subscriptions. With this view, you can immediately understand cluster health and then drill down to the node and controller performance page or navigate to see performance charts for the cluster. For clusters that were discovered and identified as unmonitored, you can enable monitoring from the view.

>[!NOTE]
>Azure Stack (Preview) and Non-Azure (Preview) are no longer supported in this view.

To access the multi-cluster view, select **Monitor** from the left pane in the Azure portal. Under the **Insights** section, select **Containers**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/azmon-containers-multiview.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an Azure Monitor multi-cluster dashboard example." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/azmon-containers-multiview.png":::

On the **Monitored clusters** tab, you learn the following:

- How many clusters are in a critical or unhealthy state versus how many are healthy or not reporting (referred to as an Unknown state).
- How many nodes and user and system pods are deployed per cluster.

The health statuses included are:

* **Critical**: One or more critical issues are detected that must be addressed to restore normal operational state as expected.
* **Warning**: One or more issues are detected that must be addressed or the health condition could become critical.
* **Unauthorized**: User doesn't have required permissions to read data in the workspace or Data Collection Rule.
* **Not found**: Either the workspace, the resource group, or subscription that contains the workspace was deleted.
* **Enable recording rules**: Enable [Prometheus recording rules](prometheus-metrics-scrape-default.md#prometheus-visualization-recording-rules) to unlock higher performance data and Prometheus visualizations.
* **Misconfigured**: Something went wrong.
* **Error**: An error occurred while attempting to read data from the workspace.
* **No data**: Data hasn't reported to the workspace for the last 30 minutes.
* **Unknown**: If the service wasn't able to make a connection with the node or pod, the status changes to an Unknown state.
* **Healthy**: No issues are detected for the VM, and it's functioning as required.
* **Pending**: Monitoring configuration for Arc-enabled clusters typically takes around 5 minutes. If the cluster is disconnected from Azure, this process may be delayed. 
* **Pending for X hours**: Monitoring configuration for the Arc-enabled cluster is taking longer than expected.
* **Failed**: Monitoring configuration for the Arc-enabled cluster was unsuccessful.

Health state calculates the overall cluster status as the *worst of* the three states with one exception. If any of the three states is Unknown, the overall cluster state shows **Unknown**.

The following table provides a breakdown of the calculation that controls the health states for a monitored cluster on the multi-cluster view.

| Monitored cluster |Status |Availability |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
|**User pod**| Healthy<br>Warning<br>Critical<br>Unknown |100%<br>90 - 99%<br><90%<br>Not reported in last 30 minutes |
|**System pod**| Healthy<br>Warning<br>Critical<br>Unknown |100%<br>N/A<br>100%<br>Not reported in last 30 minutes |
|**Node** | Healthy<br>Warning<br>Critical<br>Unknown | >85%<br>60 - 84%<br><60%<br>Not reported in last 30 minutes |

From the list of clusters, you can drill down to the **Overview** page for AKS and **Cluster** page for Arc-enabled clusters by selecting the name of the cluster. Then go to the **Nodes** performance page by selecting the rollup of nodes in the **Nodes** column for that specific cluster. Or, you can drill down to the **Controllers** performance page by selecting the rollup of the **User pods** or **System pods** column.

## View performance directly from a cluster

Access to Container insights is available directly from an AKS cluster by selecting **Monitor** from the left pane, or when you select a cluster from the multi-cluster view. For more information on Insights, please see [Managed Prometheus visualizations in Azure Monitor](container-insights-experience-v2.md).

## View container metrics in Metrics Explorer

In Metrics Explorer, you can view aggregated node and pod utilization metrics from Container insights. The following table summarizes the details to help you understand how to use the metric charts to visualize container metrics.

|Namespace | Metric | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| insights.container/nodes | |
| | cpuUsageMillicores | Aggregated measurement of CPU utilization across the cluster. It's a CPU core split into 1,000 units (milli = 1000). Used to determine the usage of cores in a container where many applications might be using one core.|
| | cpuUsagePercentage | Aggregated average CPU utilization measured in percentage across the cluster.|
| | memoryRssBytes | Container RSS memory used in bytes.|
| | memoryRssPercentage | Container RSS memory used in percent.|
| | memoryWorkingSetBytes | Container working set memory used.|
| | memoryWorkingSetPercentage | Container working set memory used in percent. |
| | nodesCount | A node count from Kubernetes.|
| insights.container/pods | |
| | PodCount | A pod count from Kubernetes.|

You can [split](../essentials/metrics-charts.md#apply-splitting) a metric to view it by dimension and visualize how different segments of it compare to each other. For a node, you can segment the chart by the *host* dimension. From a pod, you can segment it by the following dimensions:

* Controller
* Kubernetes namespace
* Node
* Phase

## Analyze nodes, controllers, and container health

When you switch to the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, and **Containers** tabs, a property pane automatically displays on the right side of the page. It shows the properties of the item selected, which includes the labels you defined to organize Kubernetes objects. When a Linux node is selected, the **Local Disk Capacity** section also shows the available disk space and the percentage used for each disk presented to the node. Select the **>>** link in the pane to view or hide the pane.

As you expand the objects in the hierarchy, the properties pane updates based on the object selected. From the pane, you also can view Kubernetes container logs (stdout/stderror), events, and pod metrics by selecting the **Live Events** tab at the top of the pane. For more information about the configuration required to grant and control access to view this data, see [Set up the Live Data](container-insights-livedata-setup.md). 

While you review cluster resources, you can see this data from the container in real time. For more information about this feature, see [How to view Kubernetes logs, events, and pod metrics in real time](container-insights-livedata-overview.md).

To view Kubernetes log data stored in your workspace based on predefined log searches, select **View container logs** from the **View in analytics** dropdown list. For more information, see [How to query logs from Container insights](container-insights-log-query.md).

Use the **+ Add Filter** option at the top of the page to filter the results for the view by **Service**, **Node**, **Namespace**, or **Node Pool**. After you select the filter scope, select one of the values shown in the **Select value(s)** field. After the filter is configured, it's applied globally while viewing any perspective of the AKS cluster. The formula only supports the equal sign. You can add more filters on top of the first one to further narrow your results. For example, if you specify a filter by **Node**, you can only select **Service** or **Namespace** for the second filter.

Specifying a filter in one tab continues to be applied when you select another. It's deleted after you select the **x** symbol next to the specified filter.

Switch to the **Nodes** tab and the row hierarchy follows the Kubernetes object model, which starts with a node in your cluster. Expand the node to view one or more pods running on the node. If more than one container is grouped to a pod, they're displayed as the last row in the hierarchy. You also can view how many non-pod-related workloads are running on the host if the host has processor or memory pressure.

Windows Server containers that run the Windows Server 2019 OS are shown after all the Linux-based nodes in the list. When you expand a Windows Server node, you can view one or more pods and containers that run on the node. After a node is selected, the properties pane shows version information.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/nodes-view-windows.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example Node hierarchy with Windows Server nodes listed." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/nodes-view-windows.png":::

Azure Container Instances virtual nodes that run the Linux OS are shown after the last AKS cluster node in the list. When you expand a Container Instances virtual node, you can view one or more Container Instances pods and containers that run on the node. Metrics aren't collected and reported for nodes, only for pods.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/nodes-view-aci.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example Node hierarchy with Container Instances listed." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/nodes-view-aci.png":::

From an expanded node, you can drill down from the pod or container that runs on the node to the controller to view performance data filtered for that controller. Select the value under the **Controller** column for the specific node.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/drill-down-node-controller.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the drill-down from node to controller in the performance view." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/drill-down-node-controller.png":::

Select controllers or containers at the top of the page to review the status and resource utilization for those objects. To review memory utilization, in the **Metric** dropdown list, select **Memory RSS** or **Memory working set**. **Memory RSS** is supported only for Kubernetes version 1.8 and later. Otherwise, you view values for **Min&nbsp;%** as *NaN&nbsp;%*, which is a numeric data type value that represents an undefined or unrepresentable value.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-node-metric-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a Container nodes performance view." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-node-metric-dropdown.png":::

**Memory working set** shows both the resident memory and virtual memory (cache) included and is a total of what the application is using. **Memory RSS** shows only main memory, which is nothing but the resident memory. This metric shows the actual capacity of available memory. What's the difference between resident memory and virtual memory?

- **Resident memory**, or main memory, is the actual amount of machine memory available to the nodes of the cluster.
- **Virtual memory** is reserved hard disk space (cache) used by the operating system to swap data from memory to disk when under memory pressure, and then fetch it back to memory when needed.

By default, performance data is based on the last six hours, but you can change the window by using the **TimeRange** option at the upper left. You also can filter the results within the time range by selecting **Min**, **Avg**, **50th**, **90th**, **95th**, and **Max** in the percentile selector.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-metric-percentile-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a percentile selection for data filtering." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-metric-percentile-filter.png":::

When you hover over the bar graph under the **Trend** column, each bar shows either CPU or memory usage, depending on which metric is selected, within a sample period of 15 minutes. After you select the trend chart through a keyboard, use the Alt+Page up key or Alt+Page down key to cycle through each bar individually. You get the same details that you would if you hovered over the bar.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-metric-trend-bar-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a Trend bar chart hover-over example." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-metric-trend-bar-01.png":::

In the next example, for the first node in the list, *aks-nodepool1-*, the value for **Containers** is 25. This value is a rollup of the total number of containers deployed.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-nodes-containerstotal.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a rollup of containers-per-node example." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-nodes-containerstotal.png":::

This information can help you quickly identify whether you have a proper balance of containers between nodes in your cluster.

The information that's presented when you view the **Nodes** tab is described in the following table.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | The name of the host. |
| Status | Kubernetes view of the node status. |
| Min&nbsp;%, Avg&nbsp;%, 50th&nbsp;%, 90th&nbsp;%, 95th&nbsp;%, Max&nbsp;%  | Average node percentage based on percentile during the selected duration. |
| Min, Avg, 50th, 90th, 95th, Max | Average nodes' actual value based on percentile during the time duration selected. The average value is measured from the CPU/Memory limit set for a node. For pods and containers, it's the average value reported by the host. |
| Containers | Number of containers. |
| Uptime | Represents the time since a node started or was rebooted. |
| Controller | Only for containers and pods. It shows which controller it resides in. Not all pods are in a controller, so some might display **N/A**. |
| Trend Min&nbsp;%, Avg&nbsp;%, 50th&nbsp;%, 90th&nbsp;%, 95th&nbsp;%, Max&nbsp;% | Bar graph trend represents the average percentile metric percentage of the controller. |

You might notice a workload after expanding a node named **Other process**. It represents non-containerized processes that run on your node, and includes:

* Self-managed or managed Kubernetes non-containerized processes.
* Container run-time processes.
* Kubelet.
* System processes running on your node.
* Other non-Kubernetes workloads running on node hardware or a VM.

It's calculated by *Total usage from CAdvisor* - *Usage from containerized process*.

In the selector, select **Controllers**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-controllers-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting Controllers.]" lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-controllers-tab.png":::

Here you can view the performance health of your controllers and Container Instances virtual node controllers or virtual node pods not connected to a controller.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-controllers-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a \<Name> controllers performance view." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-controllers-view.png":::

The row hierarchy starts with a controller. When you expand a controller, you view one or more pods. Expand a pod, and the last row displays the container grouped to the pod. From an expanded controller, you can drill down to the node it's running on to view performance data filtered for that node. Container Instances pods not connected to a controller are listed last in the list.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/controllers-view-aci.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example Controllers hierarchy with Container Instances pods listed." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/controllers-view-aci.png":::

Select the value under the **Node** column for the specific controller.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/drill-down-controller-node.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example drill-down from controller to node in the performance view." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/drill-down-controller-node.png":::

The information that's displayed when you view controllers is described in the following table.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | The name of the controller.|
| Status | The rollup status of the containers after it's finished running with status such as **OK**, **Terminated**, **Failed**, **Stopped**, or **Paused**. If the container is running but the status either wasn't properly displayed or wasn't picked up by the agent and hasn't responded for more than 30 minutes, the status is **Unknown**. More details of the status icon are provided in the following table.|
| Min&nbsp;%, Avg&nbsp;%, 50th&nbsp;%, 90th&nbsp;%, 95th&nbsp;%, Max&nbsp;%| Rollup average of the average percentage of each entity for the selected metric and percentile. |
| Min, Avg, 50th, 90th, 95th, Max  | Rollup of the average CPU millicore or memory performance of the container for the selected percentile. The average value is measured from the CPU/Memory limit set for a pod. |
| Containers | Total number of containers for the controller or pod. |
| Restarts | Rollup of the restart count from containers. |
| Uptime | Represents the time since a container started. |
| Node | Only for containers and pods. It shows which controller it resides in. |
| Trend Min&nbsp;%, Avg&nbsp;%, 50th&nbsp;%, 90th&nbsp;%, 95th&nbsp;%, Max&nbsp;% | Bar graph trend represents the average percentile metric of the controller. |

The icons in the status field indicate the online status of the containers.

| Icon | Status |
|--------|-------------|
| :::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-ready-icon.png" alt-text="Ready running status icon.":::| Running |
| :::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-waiting-icon.png" alt-text="Waiting or Paused status icon."::: | Waiting or Paused|

| :::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-green-icon.png" alt-text="Successful status icon."::: | Successfully stopped or failed to stop|

The status icon displays a count based on what the pod provides. It shows the worst two states. When you hover over the status, it displays a rollup status from all pods in the container. If there isn't a ready state, the status value displays **(0)**.

In the selector, select **Containers**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-containers-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting Containers." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-containers-tab.png":::

Here you can view the performance health of your AKS and Container Instances containers.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-containers-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a \<Name> containers performance view." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/containers-containers-view.png":::

From a container, you can drill down to a pod or node to view performance data filtered for that object. Select the value under the **Pod** or **Node** column for the specific container.

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/drill-down-container-node.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example drill-down from node to containers in the performance view." lightbox="media/container-insights-analyze/drill-down-controller-node.png":::

The information that's displayed when you view containers is described in the following table.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | The name of the controller.|
| Status | Status of the containers, if any. More details of the status icon are provided in the next table.|

| Restarts | Represents the time since a container started. |
| Uptime | Represents the time since a container was started or rebooted. |
| Trend Min&nbsp;%, Avg&nbsp;%, 50th&nbsp;%, 90th&nbsp;%, 95th&nbsp;%, Max&nbsp;% | Bar graph trend represents the average percentile metric percentage of the container. |

### Other processes
The *Other processes* entry in the **Node** view is intended to help you clearly understand the root cause of the high resource usage on your node. This information helps you to distinguish usage between containerized processes versus noncontainerized processes. These are noncontainerized processes that run on your node and include the following:
          
- Self-managed or managed Kubernetes noncontainerized processes.
- Container run-time processes.
- Kubelet.
- System processes running on your node.
- Other non-Kubernetes workloads running on node hardware or a VM.

The value of *other processes* is `Total usage from CAdvisor - Usage from containerized process`. 

### Status

The icons in the status field indicate the online statuses of pods, as described in the following table.

| Icon | Status |
|--------|-------------|
| :::image type="content" source="./media/container-insights-analyze/containers-ready-icon.png" alt-text="Ready running status icon.":::|
