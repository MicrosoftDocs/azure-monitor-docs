# Send Prometheus data to Azure Monitor by using managed identity authentication

This article describes how to set up [remote write](prometheus-remote-write.md) to send data from a self-managed Prometheus server running in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster by using managed identity authentication and a side car container provided by Azure Monitor. You can either use an existing identity that's created by AKS or [create your own](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities). Both options are described here.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the user-assigned managed identity, we recommend that you directly configure Prometheus running on your Kubernetes cluster to remote-write into Azure Monitor Workspace. See [Send Prometheus data to Azure Monitor using user-assigned managed identity](../essentials/prometheus-remote-write-virtual-machines.md#set-up-authentication-for-remote-write) to learn more. The steps below use the Azure Monitor side car container.

## Cluster configurations

This article applies to the following cluster configurations:

- Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
- Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster

> [!NOTE]
> For information about setting up remote write for a Kubernetes cluster running in a different cloud or on-premises, see [Send Prometheus data to Azure Monitor by using Microsoft Entra authentication](prometheus-remote-write-active-directory.md).

## Prerequisites

### Supported versions

Prometheus versions greater than v2.45 are required for managed identity authentication.

### Azure Monitor workspace

This article covers sending Prometheus metrics to an Azure Monitor workspace. To create an Azure monitor workspace, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#create-an-azure-monitor-workspace).

## Permissions

Administrator permissions for the cluster or resource are required to complete the steps in this article.

## Set up an application for managed identity

The process to set up Prometheus remote write for an application by using managed identity authentication involves completing the following tasks:

1. Get the name of the cluster's node resource group.
1. Get the client ID of the user-assigned managed identity.
1. Assign the Monitoring Metrics Publisher role on the workspace data collection rule to the managed identity.
1. Give the cluster access to the managed identity.
1. Deploy a sidecar container to set up remote write.

The tasks are described in the following sections.

### Get the name of the cluster's node resource group

The node resource group of the cluster contains resources that you use in other steps in this process. This resource group has the name `MC_<RESOURCE-GROUP>_<CLUSTER-NAME>_<REGION>`. You can find the resource group name by using the **Resource groups** menu in the Azure portal.

### Get the client ID of the user-assigned managed identity

You must get the client ID of the identity that you're going to use. Copy the client ID to use later in the process.

Instead of creating your own client ID, you can use one of the identities that are created by AKS. To learn more about the identities, see [Use a managed identity in Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/use-managed-identity).

This article uses the kubelet identity. The name of this identity is `<CLUSTER-NAME>-agentpool`, and it's in the node resource group of the cluster.

Select the `<CLUSTER-NAME>-agentpool` managed identity. On the **Overview** page, copy the value for **Client ID**. For more information, see [Manage user-assigned managed identities](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities).

:::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/client-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a client ID on an overview page for a managed identity." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/client-id.png":::

### Assign the Monitoring Metrics Publisher role on the workspace data collection rule to the managed identity

The managed identity must be assigned the Monitoring Metrics Publisher role on the data collection rule that is associated with your Azure Monitor workspace.

1. On the resource menu for your Azure Monitor workspace, select **Overview**. For **Data collection rule**, select the link.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/azure-monitor-account-data-collection-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the data collection rule that's associated with an Azure Monitor workspace." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/azure-monitor-account-data-collection-rule.png":::

1. On the resource menu for the data collection rule, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add**, and then select **Add role assignment**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/data-collection-rule-add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding a role assignment on Access control pages." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/data-collection-rule-add-role-assignment.png":::

1. Select the **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role, and then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a list of role assignments." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/add-role-assignment.png":::

1. Select **Managed Identity**, and then choose **Select members**. Select the subscription that contains the user-assigned identity, and then select **User-assigned managed identity**. Select the user-assigned identity that you want to use, and then choose **Select**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/select-managed-identity.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting a user-assigned managed identity." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/select-managed-identity.png":::

1. To complete the role assignment, select **Review + assign**.

### Give the AKS cluster access to the managed identity

This step isn't required if you're using an AKS identity. An AKS identity already has access to the cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete the steps in this section, you must have owner or user access administrator permissions for the cluster.

1. Identify the virtual machine scale sets in the [node resource group](#get-the-name-of-the-clusters-node-resource-group) for your cluster.

    :::image type="content" source="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/resource-group-details-virtual-machine-scale-sets.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows virtual machine scale sets in the node resource group." lightbox="media/prometheus-remote-write-managed-identity/resource-group-details-virtual-machine-scale-sets.png":::

2. For each virtual machine scale set, run the following command in the Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli
    az vmss identity assign -g <NODE-RESOURCE-GROUP> -n <VMSS-NAME> --identities <USER-ASSIGNED-IDENTITY-RESOURCE-ID>
    ```

### Deploy a sidecar container to set up remote write

1. Copy the following YAML and save it to a file. The YAML uses port 8081 as the listening port. If you use a different port, modify the port in the YAML.

    [!INCLUDE[managed-identity-yaml](../includes/prometheus-sidecar-remote-write-managed-identity-yaml.md)]

1. Replace the following values in the YAML:

    | Value | Description |
    |:---|:---|
    | `<CLUSTER-NAME>` | The name of your cluster. |
    | `<CONTAINER-IMAGE-VERSION>` | [!INCLUDE [version](../includes/prometheus-remotewrite-image-version.md)]<br> The remote write container image version.   |
    | `<INGESTION-URL>` | The value for **Metrics ingestion endpoint** from the **Overview** page for the Azure Monitor workspace. |
    | `<MANAGED-IDENTITY-CLIENT-ID>` | The value for **Client ID** from the **Overview** page for the managed identity. |
    | `<CLUSTER-NAME>` | Name of the cluster that Prometheus is running on. |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For Azure Government cloud, add the following environment variables in the `env` section of the YAML file:
   >
   > `- name: INGESTION_AAD_AUDIENCE value: https://monitor.azure.us/`

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell and upload the YAML file.
1. Use Helm to apply the YAML file and update your Prometheus configuration:

    ```azurecli
    # set context to your cluster 
    az aks get-credentials -g <aks-rg-name> -n <aks-cluster-name> 
 
    # use Helm to update your remote write config 
    helm upgrade -f <YAML-FILENAME>.yml prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace <namespace where Prometheus pod resides> 
    ```
