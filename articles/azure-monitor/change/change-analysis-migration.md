# Migrate to the Change Analysis API powered by Azure Resource Graph

[!INCLUDE [transition](../includes/change/change-analysis-is-moving.md)]

## How to migrate

You can migrate your services to the Change Analysis API powered by Resource Graph in one of two ways, depending on your integration scenario.

### Via PowerShell or the Azure CLI

If you're using PowerShell or the Azure CLI for resource changes, refer to [Get resource changes](/azure/governance/resource-graph/changes/get-resource-changes) to migrate to the Change Analysis API powered by Resource Graph.

To query the Change Analysis API powered by Resource Graph:

1. Install the Graph Query extension for Resource Graph.
    You're prompted to install this extension via the command line if it isn't already installed.

1. Use Kusto Query Language (KQL).
    Resource Graph queries use the full power of KQL, which provides granular filtering so that you can see specific values. The classic method returns all values.

To review how youâ€™re using the classic experience, refer to the following links. You can perform queries within a specified time range and scope them by subscription, resource group, or resource.

- **PowerShell**: [`Get-AzChangeAnalysis` (`Az.ChangeAnalysis`)](/powershell/module/az.changeanalysis/get-azchangeanalysis)
- **Azure CLI**: [`az change-analysis`](/cli/azure/change-analysis)

Learn more by using the [Resource Graph guidance](/azure/governance/resource-graph/changes/get-resource-changes).

### Via SDK

If you're calling the Change Analysis REST API directly (without CLI or PowerShell) via the Resource Graph .NET SDK or the Change Analysis .NET SDK, use the following links:

- **Resource Graph Change Analysis SDK**: [`ResourceGraphExtensions` Class (`Azure.ResourceManager.ResourceGraph`)](/dotnet/api/azure.resourcemanager.resourcegraph.resourcegraphextensions)

    Here are some code samples for the resources table: [`azure-sdk-for-net/sdk/resourcegraph/Azure.ResourceManager.ResourceGraph/samples/Generated/Samples/Sample_TenantResourceExtensions.cs`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/resourcegraph/Azure.ResourceManager.ResourceGraph/samples/Generated/Samples/Sample_TenantResourceExtensions.cs)

- **Classic SDK**: [`ChangeAnalysisExtensions` Class](/dotnet/api/azure.resourcemanager.changeanalysis.changeanalysisextensions)

## What the Change Analysis API powered by Resource Graph provides

At a high level, the updated Change Analysis API offers:

- **Real-time insights**: Monitor changes occurring on your resources [directly within the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_OneInventory/ResourceChangesOverview.ReactView).
- **Granular filtering**: Filter changes based on the type of change, such as creation, updates, deletions, subscriptions, resource groups, and timeframes.
- **Grouping capabilities**: Group changes by various parameters, such as subscription, resource group, type, resource, change type, client type, and more.
- **Change actor identification**: Gain visibility into the individuals responsible for making changes and the methods used for those modifications.
- **Cross-query**: Join across tables to look for changes based on dynamic values in the current resources' configurations, such as tags and location.
- **Alerting**: With the Resource Graph Log Analytics connector, create alerts on your changes, such as when a change to a resource was made through the Azure portal.
