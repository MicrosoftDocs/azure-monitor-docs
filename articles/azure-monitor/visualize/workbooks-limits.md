# Workbooks result limits

Data source, visualization, and parameter limits have some points in common:

- In general, Azure Workbooks limits the results of queries to no more than 10,000 results. Any results after that point are truncated.
- Each data source might have its own specific limits based on the limits of the service it queries.
- Those limits might be on the numbers of resources, regions, results returned, and time ranges. Consult the documentation for each service to find those limits.

## Data source limits

This table lists the limits of specific data sources.
