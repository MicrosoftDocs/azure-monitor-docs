## Troubleshoot the Azure Windows VM extension

If the Microsoft Monitoring Agent VM extension isn't installing or reporting, perform the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check if the Azure VM agent is installed and working correctly by using the steps in [KB 2965986](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2965986#mt1):
   * You can also review the VM agent log file `C:\WindowsAzure\logs\WaAppAgent.log`.
   * If the log doesn't exist, the VM agent isn't installed.
   * [Install the Azure VM Agent](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows#install-the-azure-windows-vm-agent).
1. Review the Microsoft Monitoring Agent VM extension log files in `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent`.
1. Ensure the virtual machine can run PowerShell scripts.
1. Ensure permissions on C:\Windows\temp haven't been changed.
1. View the status of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent by entering `(New-Object -ComObject 'AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg').GetCloudWorkspaces() | Format-List` in an elevated PowerShell window on the virtual machine.
1. Review the Microsoft Monitoring Agent setup log files in `C:\WindowsAzure\Logs\Plugins\Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.MicrosoftMonitoringAgent\1.0.18053.0\`. This path changes based on the version number of the agent.

If the Log Analytics agent for Linux VM extension isn't installing or reporting, perform the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. If the extension status is **Unknown**, check if the Azure VM agent is installed and working correctly by reviewing the VM agent log file `/var/log/waagent.log`.
   * If the log doesn't exist, the VM agent isn't installed.
   * [Install the Azure VM Agent on Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux#installation).
1. For other unhealthy statuses, review the Log Analytics agent for Linux VM extension logs files in `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.OmsAgentForLinux/*/extension.log` and `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring.OmsAgentForLinux/*/CommandExecution.log`.
1. If the extension status is healthy but data isn't being uploaded, review the Log Analytics agent for Linux log files in `/var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`.
