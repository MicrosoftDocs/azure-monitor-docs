<sup>1</sup> Requires Python (2 or 3) to be installed on the machine. Requires packages _which_ and _initscripts_.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Also supported on Arm64-based machines.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Does not include the required least 4GB of disk space by default. See note below.

> [!NOTE]
> Machines and appliances that run heavily customized or stripped-down versions of the above distributions and hosted solutions that disallow customization by the user are not supported. Azure Monitor relies on various packages and other baseline functionality that is often removed from such systems, and their installation may require some environmental modifications considered to be disallowed by the appliance vendor. For example, [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server) is not supported due to heavy customization as well as [documented, license-level disallowance](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/overview/system-overview#operating-system-software-and-patches) of operating system modification.

> [!NOTE]
> CBL-Mariner 2.0's disk size is by default about 1GB to provide storage savings, compared to other Azure VMs that are about 30GB. The Azure Monitor Agent requires at least 4GB disk size in order to install and run successfully. See [CBL-Mariner's documentation](https://eng.ms/docs/products/mariner-linux/gettingstarted/azurevm/azurevm#disk-size) for more information and instructions on how to increase disk size before installing the agent.

## Hardening standards
Azure Monitoring Agent supports most industry-standard hardening standards and is continuously tested and certified against these standards every release. All Azure Monitor Agent scenarios are designed from the ground up with security in mind.

### Windows hardening
Azure Monitoring Agent supports all standard Windows hardening standards, including STIG and FIPs, and is FedRamp compliant under Azure Monitor.

### Linux hardening

> [!NOTE]
> Only the Azure Monitoring Agent for Linux supports these hardening standards. They are not supported by the [Azure Diagnostics extension](./diagnostics-extension-overview.md).

The Azure Monitoring Agent for Linux supports various hardening standards for Linux operating systems and distros. Every release of the agent is tested and certified against the supported hardening standards using images that are publicly available on the Azure Marketplace, including those published by [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](/compliance/regulatory/offering-cis-benchmark). Only the settings and hardening that are applied to those images are supported. CIS-published images with additional customizations and images customized with settings and hardening that differs from official CIS benchmarks are not supported.

Currently supported hardening standards:
- SELinux
- CIS level 1 and 2<sup>1</sup>
- STIG
- FIPS
- FedRAMP

<sup>1</sup> Only the below-listed distributions are supported:<br>

| CIS-hardened operating system | Support |
|:---|:---:|
| CentOS Linux 7                    | ✓ |
| Debian 10                         | ✓ |
| Oracle Linux 8                    | ✓ |
| Ubuntu 18.04 LTS                  | ✓ |
| Ubuntu 20.04 LTS                  | ✓ |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7 | ✓ |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 8 | ✓ |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 9 | ✓ |

## On-premises and other clouds
Azure Monitor agent is supported on machines in other clouds and on-premises with [Azure Arc-enabled servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview). Azure Monitor agent authenticates to your workspace with managed identity, which is created when you install the [Connected Machine agent](/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview), which is part of Azure Arc. The legacy Log Analytics agent authenticated using the workspace ID and key, so it didn't need Azure Arc. Managed identity is a more secure and manageable authentication solution. 

The Azure Arc agent is only used as an installation mechanism and does not add any cost or resource consumption. There are paid options for Azure Arc, but these aren't required for the Azure Monitor agent.



## Next steps

- [Install the Azure Monitor Agent](azure-monitor-agent-manage.md) on Windows and Linux virtual machines.
- [Identify requirements and prerequisites](azure-monitor-agent-requirements.md) for Azure Monitor Agent installation.
