# Troubleshooting guidance for the Azure Monitor agent on Windows Arc-enabled server

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-agent-architecture](../../../includes/azure-monitor-agent/azure-monitor-agent-architecture-include.md)]

## Basic troubleshooting steps (installation, agent not running, configuration issues)
Follow the steps below to troubleshoot the latest version of the Azure Monitor agent running on your Windows Arc-enabled server:

1. **Carefully review the [prerequisites here](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#prerequisites).**  

2. **Verify that the extension was successfully installed and provisioned, which installs the agent binaries on your machine**:  
    1. Open Azure portal > select your Arc-enabled server > Open **Settings** : **Extensions** from the pane on the left > 'AzureMonitorWindowsAgent'should show up with Status: 'Succeeded'  
    2. If not, check if the Arc agent (Connected Machine Agent) is able to connect to Azure and the extension service is running. 
        ```azurecli
        azcmagent show
        ```   
        You should see the below output:
        ```
        Resource Name                           : <server name>
        [...]
        Dependent Service Status
          Agent Service (himds)                 : running
          GC Service (gcarcservice)             : running
          Extension Service (extensionservice)  : running
        ```
    3. Wait for 10-15 minutes as extension maybe in transitioning status. If it still doesn't show up, [uninstall and install the extension](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md) again and repeat the verification to see the extension show up. 
    4. If not, check if you see any errors in extension logs located at `C:\ProgramData\GuestConfig\extension_logs\Microsoft.Azure.Monitor.AzureMonitorWindowsAgent` on your machine  

3. **Verify that the agent is running**:  
    1. Check if the agent is emitting heartbeat logs to Log Analytics workspace using the query below. Skip if 'Custom Metrics' is the only destination in the DCR:
        ```Kusto
        Heartbeat | where Category == "Azure Monitor Agent" and Computer == "<computer-name>" | take 10
        ```
    2. If not, open Task Manager and check if 'MonAgentCore.exe' process is running. If it is, wait for 5 minutes for heartbeat to show up.  
    3. If not, check if you see any errors in core agent logs located at `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\Configuration` on your machine  
    
4. **Verify that the DCR exists and is associated with the Arc-enabled server:**  
    1. If using Log Analytics workspace as destination, verify that DCR exists in the same physical region as the Log Analytics workspace.  
    2. On your Arc-enabled server, verify the existence of the file `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\mcs\mcsconfig.latest.xml`. If this file doesn't exist, the Arc-enabled server may not be associated with a DCR. 
    3. Open Azure portal > select your data collection rule > Open **Configuration** : **Resources** from the pane on the left > You should see the Arc-enabled server listed here  
    4. If not listed, click 'Add' and select your Arc-enabled server from the resource picker. Repeat across all DCRs.

5. **Verify that agent was able to download the associated DCR(s) from AMCS service:**  
    1. Check if you see the latest DCR downloaded at this location `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\mcs\configchunks` 

## Issues collecting Performance counters
1. Check that your DCR JSON contains a section for 'performanceCounters'. If not, fix your DCR. See [how to create DCR](./azure-monitor-agent-data-collection.md) or [sample DCR](./data-collection-rule-sample-agent.md).
2. Check that the file `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\mcs\mcsconfig.lkg.xml` exists.
3. Open the file and check if it contains `CounterSet` nodes as shown in the example below:
    ```xml
    <CounterSet storeType="Local" duration="PT1M" 
        eventName="c9302257006473204344_16355538690556228697" 
        sampleRateInSeconds="15" format="Factored">
        <Counter>\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time</Counter>
        <Counter>\Memory\Committed Bytes</Counter>
        <Counter>\LogicalDisk(_Total)\Free Megabytes</Counter>
        <Counter>\PhysicalDisk(_Total)\Avg. Disk Queue Length</Counter>
    </CounterSet>
    ```


### Issues using 'Custom Metrics' as destination
1. Carefully review the [prerequisites here](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#prerequisites).  
2. Ensure that the associated DCR is correctly authored to collect performance counters and send them to Azure Monitor metrics. You should see this section in your DCR:
    ```json
    "destinations": {  
    "azureMonitorMetrics": {  
        "name":"myAmMetricsDest" 
        } 
    }
    ```
    
3. Run PowerShell command:
    ```powershell
    Get-WmiObject Win32_Process -Filter "name = 'MetricsExtension.Native.exe'" | select Name,ExecutablePath,CommandLine | Format-List
    ```
    
    Verify that the *CommandLine* parameter in the output contains the argument "-TokenSource MSI"
4. Verify `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\mcs\AuthToken-MSI.json` file is present.
5. Verify `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\mcs\CUSTOMMETRIC_<subscription>_<region>_MonitoringAccount_Configuration.json` file is present.
6. Collect logs by running the command `C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.Monitor.AzureMonitorWindowsAgent\<version-number>\Monitoring\Agent\table2csv.exe C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\Tables\MaMetricsExtensionEtw.tsf`
    1. The command will generate the file 'MaMetricsExtensionEtw.csv'
    2. Open it and look for any Level 2 errors and try to fix them.

## Issues collecting Windows event logs
1. Check that your DCR JSON contains a section for 'windowsEventLogs'. If not, fix your DCR. See [how to create DCR](./azure-monitor-agent-data-collection.md) or [sample DCR](./data-collection-rule-sample-agent.md).
2. Check that the file `C:\Resources\Directory\AMADataStore\mcs\mcsconfig.lkg.xml` exists.
3. Open the file and check if it contains `Subscription` nodes as shown in the example below:
    ```xml
    <Subscription eventName="c9302257006473204344_14882095577508259570" 
    query="System!*[System[(Level = 1 or Level = 2 or Level = 3)]]">
        <Column name="ProviderGuid" type="mt:wstr" defaultAssignment="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000">
          <Value>/Event/System/Provider/@Guid</Value>
        </Column>
        ...
        
        </Column>
    </Subscription>
    ```
