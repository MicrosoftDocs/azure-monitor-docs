# Azure Monitor Agent extension versions


This article describes the version details for the Azure Monitor Agent virtual machine extension. This extension deploys the agent on virtual machines, scale sets, and Arc-enabled servers (on-premises servers with Azure Arc agent installed).

[//]: # "> [!Note]"
Microsoft only supports Azure Monitoring Agent versions within the last 1 year based on the automatic release date. Customers should update to a version within this period. Microsoft releases all bug fixes in the latest version only.

We strongly recommend that you always update to the latest version, or opt in to the [Automatic Extension Update](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-extension-upgrade) feature.  

- Agent versions release once each month. The latest version deploys over a fortnight, and you may see it in some regions before others. You can manually install the release once it is in a VMs region.
- Automatic rollout follows Azure safe deployment practices and will complete in a month and a half following the release month. Deployments are issued in batches, so you may see some of your virtual machines, scale-sets or Arc-enabled servers on different release during the rollout.
- Release notes will be available during the lates version rollout.
