# Azure Monitor Agent extension versions

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and planning accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

This article describes the version details for the Azure Monitor Agent virtual machine extension. This extension deploys the agent on virtual machines, scale sets, and Arc-enabled servers (on-premises servers with Azure Arc agent installed).

We strongly recommended to always update to the latest version, or opt in to the [Automatic Extension Update](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-extension-upgrade) feature. A version is not automatically rolled out until it meets a high quality bar which can take as long as 5 weeks after the initial release. 

[//]: # "DON'T change the format (column schema, etc.) of the table without consulting glinuxagent alias. The [Azure Monitor Linux Agent Troubleshooting Tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions/blob/master/AzureMonitorAgent/ama_tst/AMA-Troubleshooting-Tool.md) parses the table at runtime to determine the latest version of AMA; altering the format could degrade some of the functions of the tool."

## Version details
| Release Date | Release notes | Windows | Linux |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| November 2024 | **Windows Features**<ul><li>Update priorities for selection of ARC/AMA/System Proxy.

| October 2024 | **Windows Features**<ul><li>AMA: Updating AMA proxy settings to allow the Arc proxy to be bypassed</li><li>AMA: Custom Logs support Timestamp as delimiter (for MMA parity). You must deploy it using a DCR template or through the CLI. UI support is coming in the December release.</li><li>Enhance security for file operation when data folder contain redirection</li><li>Update MetricsExtension version to v2.2024.726.1005</li></ul>| 1.30.0| |

| August 2024      | **Windows**<ul><li>Added columns to the SecurityEvent table: Keywords, Opcode, Correlation, ProcessId, ThreadId, EventRecordId.</li><li>AMA: Support AMA Client Installer support for W365 Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) tenants/partners.</li><li>Fix for missing logs in the 'RenderedDescription' column.</li></ul>**Linux Features**<ul><li>Enable Dynamic Linking of OpenSSL 1.1 in all regions</li><li>Add Computer field to Custom Logs</li><li>Add EventHub upload support for Custom Logs </li><li>Reliability improvement for upload task scheduling</li><li>Added support for SUSE15 SP5, and AWS 3 distributions</li></ul>**Linux Fixes**<ul><li>Fix Direct upload to storage for perf counters when no other destination is configured.

This exceeds ingestion limits and destabilizes the agent. Now the row is gracefully dropped and a diagnostic message is written.</li><li>Set max disk space used for rsyslog spooling to 1GB. There was no limit before which could lead to high memory usage.</li><li>Use random available TCP port when there is a port conflict with AMA port 28230 and 28330 . This resolved issues where port 28230 and 28330 were already in uses by the customer which prevented data upload to Azure.</li><li>Fix to AMACoreAgent crash in certain architectures affecting custom log collection</li></ul>| 1.29 | 1.32.6 |

Example error is Fluentbit log with "[C:\projects\fluent-bit-2e87g\src\flb_scheduler.c:72 errno=0] No error" fills up the entire disk of the server.</li><li>Fixed AMA extension getting stuck in deletion state on some VMs that are using Arc. This fix improves reliability.</li><li>Fixed AMA not using system proxy, this issue is a bug introduced in 1.26.0. The issue was caused by a new feature that uses the Arc agent’s proxy settings.

| March 2024    | **Known Issues - ** a change in 1.25.0 to the encoding of resource IDs in the request headers to the ingestion end point has disrupted SQL ATP. This is causing failures in alert notifications to the Microsoft Detection Center (MDC) and potentially affecting billing events. Symptom is not seeing expected alerts related to SQL security threats. 1.25.0 didn't release to all data centers and it wasn't identified for auto update in any data center. Customers that did upgrade to 1.25.0 should roll back to 1.24.0<br><br>**Windows**<ul><li>**Breaking Change from Public Preview to GA** Due to customer feedback, automatic parsing of JSON into column in your custom table in Log Analytic was added.

<sup>1</sup> Known issue: No data collected from Linux Arc-enabled servers.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> Known issue: Linux performance counters data stops flowing on restarting or rebooting the machines.

## Next steps

- [Install and manage the extension](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md).
- [Create a data collection rule](./azure-monitor-agent-data-collection.md) to collect data from the agent and send it to Azure Monitor.
