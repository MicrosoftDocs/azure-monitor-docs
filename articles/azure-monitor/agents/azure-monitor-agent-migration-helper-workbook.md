# Azure Monitor Agent Migration Helper workbook

Azure Monitor Agent Migration Helper workbook is a workbook-based Azure Monitor solution that helps you discover what to migrate and track progress as you move from Log Analytics Agent to Azure Monitor Agent. Use this single pane of glass view to expedite and track the status of your agent migration journey. The helper now supports multiple subscriptions, and includes automatic migration recommendations based on your usage.

## Using the AMA workbook

To open the workbook:
1. Navigate to the **Monitor** page in the Azure portal, and select **Workbooks**. 
1. In the **Workbooks** pane, scroll down to the **AMA Migration Helper** workbook, and select it.

The workbook opens on the **Subscriptions Overview** tab. 
This page provides a high-level view of the resources in your subscriptions, which agents are deployed, and the migration status. Use this page to keep track of the migration status of your resources across your subscriptions.

On the subscriptions overview tab, the workbook automatically detects the following resources:
- Subscriptions 
- Workspaces
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets
- Arc-enabled servers
- Hybrid machines without Arc where the legacy agent is deployed

Each item has a tab that provides a detailed view of the resources in that category.

 :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-monitor-agent-migration-helper-workbook/subscriptions-overview.png" lightbox="./media/azure-monitor-agent-migration-helper-workbook/subscriptions-overview.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing subscriptions overview tab.":::

The Migration status table appears at the bottom of the page.

The table includes the following columns:
- Subscription
- Resource Type
- Resource count
- How many resources have both agents deployed
- How many resources have only the Log Analytics Agent deployed
- How many resources have only the Azure Monitor Agent deployed
- Migration status

The table can be exported to Excel to allow you to work offline or share the data.

The following image shows the migration status table with the following statuses:

- Not Started: Resources that don't have any Azure Monitor Agents deployed.
- In progress: Resources that have both agents deployed.
- Completed: Resources that have only the Azure Monitor Agent deployed.

### Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Arc-enabled servers tabs

The Azure Virtual Machines and Scale Sets tabs provides a detailed view of the Azure Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Arc-enabled serves in your subscriptions. These machines are listed regardless of the workspace to which they send telemetry. 
The table provides a view of the migration status is per machine showing which agents are deployed, the last time a heartbeat was sent to one of your workspaces, and the migration status.

### Hybrid machines without Arc

The Hybrid machines without Arc tab provide a detailed view of the hybrid machines in your subscriptions that aren't Arc-enables but have the legacy agent deployed. The table includes the Log Analytics workspace that the machine sends telemetry to, the last time the machine sent a heartbeat to the workspace
