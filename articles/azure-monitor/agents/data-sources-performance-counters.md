# Collect Windows and Linux performance data sources with the Log Analytics agent
Performance counters in Windows and Linux provide insight into the performance of hardware components, operating systems, and applications. Azure Monitor can collect performance counters from Log Analytics agents at frequent intervals for near real time analysis. Azure Monitor can also aggregate performance data for longer-term analysis and reporting.

## Configure performance counters
Configure performance counters from the [Legacy agents management menu](../agents/agent-data-sources.md#configure-data-sources) for the Log Analytics workspace.

When you first configure Windows or Linux performance counters for a new workspace, you're given the option to quickly create several common counters. They're listed with a checkbox next to each. Ensure that any counters you want to initially create are selected and then select **Add the selected performance counters**.

For Windows performance counters, you can choose a specific instance for each performance counter. For Linux performance counters, the instance of each counter that you choose applies to all child counters of the parent counter. The following table shows the common instances available to both Windows and Linux performance counters.

| Instance name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \_Total |Total of all the instances |
| \* |All instances |
| (/&#124;/var) |Matches instances named / or /var |

### Windows performance counters

:::image type="content" source="media/data-sources-performance-counters/configure-windows.png" lightbox="media/data-sources-performance-counters/configure-windows.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuring Windows performance counters.":::

Follow this procedure to add a new Windows performance counter to collect. V2 Windows performance counters aren't supported.

1. Select **Add performance counter**.
1. Enter the name of the counter in the text box in the format *object(instance)\counter*. When you start typing, a matching list of common counters appears. You can either select a counter from the list or enter one of your own. You can also return all instances for a particular counter by specifying *object\counter*.

    When SQL Server performance counters are collected from named instances, all named instance counters start with *MSSQL$* followed by the name of the instance. For example, to collect the Log Cache Hit Ratio counter for all databases from the Database performance object for named SQL instance INST2, specify `MSSQL$INST2:Databases(*)\Log Cache Hit Ratio`.

1. When you add a counter, it uses the default of 10 seconds for its **Sample Interval**. Change this default value to a higher value of up to 1,800 seconds (30 minutes) if you want to reduce the storage requirements of the collected performance data.
1. After you're finished adding counters, select **Apply** at the top of the screen to save the configuration.

### Linux performance counters

:::image type="content" source="media/data-sources-performance-counters/configure-linux.png" lightbox="media/data-sources-performance-counters/configure-linux.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuring Linux performance counters.":::

Follow this procedure to add a new Linux performance counter to collect.

1. Select **Add performance counter**.
1. Enter the name of the counter in the text box in the format *object(instance)\counter*. When you start typing, a matching list of common counters appears. You can either select a counter from the list or enter one of your own.
1. All counters for an object use the same **Sample Interval**. The default is 10 seconds. Change this default value to a higher value of up to 1,800 seconds (30 minutes) if you want to reduce the storage requirements of the collected performance data.
1. After you're finished adding counters, select **Apply** at the top of the screen to save the configuration.

#### Configure Linux performance counters in a configuration file
Instead of configuring Linux performance counters by using the Azure portal, you have the option of editing configuration files on the Linux agent. Performance metrics to collect are controlled by the configuration in */etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/\<workspace id\>/conf/omsagent.conf*.

Each object, or category, of performance metrics to collect should be defined in the configuration file as a single `<source>` element. The syntax follows the pattern here:

```xml
<source>
    type oms_omi  
    object_name "Processor"
    instance_regex ".*"
    counter_name_regex ".*"
    interval 30s
</source>
```

The parameters in this element are described in the following table.

| Parameters | Description |
|:--|:--|
| object\_name | Object name for the collection. |
| instance\_regex | A *regular expression* that defines which instances to collect. The value `.*` specifies all instances. To collect processor metrics for only the \_Total instance, you could specify `_Total`. To collect process metrics for only the crond or sshd instances, you could specify `(crond\|sshd)`. |
| counter\_name\_regex | A *regular expression* that defines which counters (for the object) to collect. To collect all counters for the object, specify `.*`. To collect only swap space counters for the memory object, for example, you could specify `.+Swap.+` |
| interval | Frequency at which the object's counters are collected. |

The following table lists the objects and counters that you can specify in the configuration file. More counters are available for certain applications. For more information, see [Collect performance counters for Linux applications in Azure Monitor](data-sources-linux-applications.md).

| Object name | Counter name |
|:--|:--|

| System | Free Physical Memory |
| System | Free Space in Paging Files |
| System | Free Virtual Memory |
| System | Processes |
| System | Size Stored In Paging Files |
| System | Uptime |
| System | Users |

The following configuration is the default for performance metrics:

```xml
<source>
    type oms_omi
	object_name "Physical Disk"
	instance_regex ".*"
	counter_name_regex ".*"
	interval 5m
</source>

<source>
	type oms_omi
	object_name "Logical Disk"
	instance_regex ".*"
	counter_name_regex ".*"
	interval 5m
</source>

<source>
    type oms_omi
	object_name "Processor"
	instance_regex ".*"
	counter_name_regex ".*"
	interval 30s
</source>

<source>
	type oms_omi
	object_name "Memory"
	instance_regex ".*"
	counter_name_regex ".*"
	interval 30s
</source>
```

## Data collection
Azure Monitor collects all specified performance counters at their specified sample interval on all agents that have that counter installed. The data isn't aggregated. The raw data is available in all log query views for the duration specified by your Log Analytics workspace.

## Performance record properties
Performance records have a type of **Perf** and have the properties listed in the following table.

| Property | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Computer |Computer that the event was collected from. |
| CounterName |Name of the performance counter. |
| CounterPath |Full path of the counter in the form \\\\\<Computer>\\object(instance)\\counter. |
| CounterValue |Numeric value of the counter. |
| InstanceName |Name of the event instance. Empty if no instance. |
| ObjectName |Name of the performance object. |
| SourceSystem |Type of agent the data was collected from: <br><br>OpsManager – Windows agent, either direct connect or SCOM <br> Linux – All Linux agents <br> AzureStorage – Azure Diagnostics |
| TimeGenerated |Date and time the data was sampled. |

## Sizing estimates
 A rough estimate for collection of a particular counter at 10-second intervals is about 1 MB per day per instance. You can estimate the storage requirements of a particular counter with the following formula:

> 1 MB x (number of counters) x (number of agents) x (number of instances)

## Log queries with performance records
The following table provides different examples of log queries that retrieve performance records.
