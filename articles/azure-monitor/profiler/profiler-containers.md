# Customer Intent: As a .NET developer, I'd like to learn how to enable the Profiler on my ASP.NET Core application running in my container.

# Enable the .NET Profiler on Azure containers

You can enable the Application Insights Profiler for .NET on applications running in your container almost without code. To enable the .NET Profiler on your container instance, you need to:

- Add the reference to the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore` NuGet package.
- Update the code to enable the Profiler for .NET.
- Set up the Application Insights instrumentation key.

In this article, you learn about the various ways that you can:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Install the NuGet package in the project.
> - Set the environment variable via the orchestrator (like Kubernetes).
> - Learn security considerations around production deployment, like protecting your Application Insights instrumentation key.

## Prerequisites

- [An Application Insights resource](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource). Make note of the instrumentation key.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to build Docker images.
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.

## Set up the environment

1. Clone and use the following [sample project](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Profiler-AspNetCore/tree/main/examples/EnableServiceProfilerForContainerAppNet6):
      
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Profiler-AspNetCore.git
      ```

1. Go to the Container App example:

   ```bash
   cd examples/EnableServiceProfilerForContainerAppNet6
   ```

1. This example is a barebones project created by calling the following CLI command:

   ```powershell
   dotnet new mvc -n EnableServiceProfilerForContainerApp
   ```

   We've added delay in the `Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs` project to simulate the bottleneck.

   ```csharp
   [HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
   public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
   {
       SimulateDelay();
       ...
       // Other existing code.
   }
   private void SimulateDelay()
   {
       // Delay for 500ms to 2s to simulate a bottleneck.
       Thread.Sleep((new Random()).Next(500, 2000));
   }
   ```

1. Add the NuGet package to collect the .NET Profiler traces:

   ```console
   dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Profiler.AspNetCore
   ```

1. Enable Application Insights and the .NET Profiler.

   ### [ASP.NET Core 6 and later](#tab/net-core-new)
   
   Add `builder.Services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` and `builder.Services.AddServiceProfiler()` after the `WebApplication.CreateBuilder()` method in `Program.cs`:
   
   ```csharp
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

   builder.Services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(); // Add this line of code to enable Application Insights.
   builder.Services.AddServiceProfiler(); // Add this line of code to enable Profiler
   builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

   var app = builder.Build();
   ```   

   ### [ASP.NET Core 5 and earlier](#tab/net-core-old)
   
   Add `services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` and `services.AddServiceProfiler()` to the `ConfigureServices()` method in `Startup.cs`:

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
     services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(); // Add this line of code to enable Application Insights.
     services.AddServiceProfiler(); // Add this line of code to enable Profiler
     services.AddControllersWithViews();
   }
   ```

## Pull the latest ASP.NET Core build/runtime images

1. Go to the .NET Core 6.0 example directory:

   ```bash
   cd examples/EnableServiceProfilerForContainerAppNet6
   ```

1. Pull the latest ASP.NET Core images:

   ```shell
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
   ```

> [!TIP]
> Find the official images for the Docker [SDK](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk) and [runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet).

## Add your Application Insights key

1. Via your Application Insights resource in the Azure portal, take note of your Application Insights instrumentation key.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/profiler-containerinstances/application-insights-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows finding the instrumentation key in the Azure portal.":::

1. Open `appsettings.json` and add your Application Insights instrumentation key to this code section:

   ```json
   {
       "ApplicationInsights":
       {
           "InstrumentationKey": "Your instrumentation key"
       }
   }
   ```

## Build and run the Docker image

1. Review the Docker file.

1. Build the example image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t profilerapp .
   ```

1. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name testapp profilerapp
   ```

## View the container via your browser

To hit the endpoint, you have two options:

- Visit `http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast` in your browser.
- Use curl:
   
  ```terraform
  curl http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast
  ```

## Inspect the logs

Optionally, inspect the local log to see if a session of profiling finished:

```bash
docker logs testapp
```

In the local logs, note the following events:
   
```output
Starting application insights profiler with instrumentation key: your-instrumentation key # Double check the instrumentation key
Service Profiler session started.               # Profiler started.
Finished calling trace uploader. Exit code: 0   # Uploader is called with exit code 0.
Service Profiler session finished.              # A profiling session is completed.
```

## View the .NET Profiler traces

1. Wait for 2 to 5 minutes so that the events can be aggregated to Application Insights.
1. Open the **Performance** pane in your Application Insights resource.
1. After the trace process is finished, the **Profiler Traces** button appears.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/profiler-containerinstances/profiler-traces.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the .NET Profiler traces button in the Performance pane.":::

## Clean up resources

Run the following command to stop the example project:

```bash
docker rm -f testapp
```
