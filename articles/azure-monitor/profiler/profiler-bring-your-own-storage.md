# Configure BYOS for Application Insights Profiler for .NET and Snapshot Debugger

When you use [Application Insights Profiler for .NET](./profiler-overview.md) or [Snapshot Debugger](../snapshot-debugger/snapshot-debugger.md), artifacts generated by your application are uploaded by default into Azure Storage accounts over the public internet. For these artifacts and storage accounts, Microsoft controls and covers the cost for:

- Processing and analysis.
- Encryption-at-rest and lifetime management policies.

Meanwhile, when you "bring your own storage" (BYOS), artifacts are uploaded into a storage account that only you control and cover the cost for:

- The encryption-at-rest policy and the Lifetime management policy.
- Network access.

> [!NOTE]
> BYOS is required if you're enabling Azure Private Link or customer-managed keys.
>
> - [Learn more about Private Link for Application Insights](../logs/private-link-security.md).
> - [Learn more about customer-managed keys for Application Insights](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md).

In this guide, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Grant Diagnostic Services access to your storage account.
> - Link your storage account with your Application Insights resource.
> - Learn how your storage account is accessed.

## Prerequisites

- Verify you created your storage account in the same location as your Application Insights resource.
- If you enabled [Private Link](../logs/private-link-security.md), allow connection to our Trusted Microsoft Service from your virtual network.

## Grant Diagnostic Services access to your storage account

A BYOS storage account is linked to an Application Insights resource. Start by granting the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role to the Microsoft Entra application named `Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access` via the [Access Control (IAM)](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) page in your storage account.  

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment** to open the **Add role assignment** page.

1. Assign the following role. 
  
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Role | Storage Blob Data Contributor |
    | Assign access to | User, group, or service principal |
    | Members | Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access |

> [!NOTE]    
> If you're also using Private Link, one more configuration is required to allow connection to our Trusted Microsoft Service from your virtual network. For more information, see [Storage network security documentation](/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#trusted-microsoft-services).

## Link your storage account with your Application Insights resource

You have three options for configuring BYOS for code-level diagnostics like the .NET Profiler and Snapshot Debugger:

- Azure PowerShell cmdlets
- The Azure CLI
- Azure Resource Manager templates

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Before you begin, [install Azure PowerShell 4.2.0 or greater](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

1. Install the Application Insights PowerShell extension.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name Az.ApplicationInsights -Force
    ```

1. Sign in with your Azure account subscription.

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount -Subscription "{subscription_id}"
    ```

    For more information on how to sign in, see the [Connect-AzAccount documentation](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount).

1. Remove any previous storage account linked to your Application Insights resource.

    Pattern:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "{resource_group_name}" -Name "{application_insights_name}" | Remove-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -Name "byos-test-westus2-ai" | Remove-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount
    ```

1. Connect your storage account with your Application Insights resource.
  
    Pattern:

    ```powershell
    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "{resource_group_name}" -Name "{storage_account_name}"
    Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "{resource_group_name}" -Name "{application_insights_name}" | New-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount -LinkedStorageAccountResourceId $storageAccount.Id
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -Name "byosteststoragewestus2"
    Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -Name "byos-test-westus2-ai" | New-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount -LinkedStorageAccountResourceId $storageAccount.Id
    ```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Before you begin, [install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

1. Install the Application Insights CLI extension.

    ```azurecli
    az extension add -n application-insights
    ```

1. Connect your storage account with your Application Insights resource.

    Pattern:

    ```azurecli
    az monitor app-insights component linked-storage link --resource-group "{resource_group_name}" --app "{application_insights_name}" --storage-account "{storage_account_name}"
    ```
  
    Example:

    ```azurecli
    az monitor app-insights component linked-storage link --resource-group "byos-test" --app "byos-test-westus2-ai" --storage-account "byosteststoragewestus2"
    ```
  
    Expected output:

    ```powershell
    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourcegroups/byos-test/providers/microsoft.insights/components/byos-test-westus2-ai/linkedstorageaccounts/serviceprofiler",
      "linkedStorageAccount": "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/byos-test/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/byosteststoragewestus2",
      "name": "serviceprofiler",
      "resourceGroup": "byos-test",
      "type": "microsoft.insights/components/linkedstorageaccounts"
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For performing updates on the linked storage accounts to your Application Insights resource, see the [Application Insights CLI documentation](/cli/azure/monitor/app-insights/component/linked-storage).

#### [Resource Manager template](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

1. Create an Azure Resource Manager template file with the following content (*byos.template.json*):

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "applicationinsights_name": {
          "type": "String"
        },
        "storageaccount_name": {
          "type": "String"
        }
      },
      "variables": {},
      "resources": [
        {
          "name": "[concat(parameters('applicationinsights_name'), '/serviceprofiler')]",
          "type": "Microsoft.Insights/components/linkedStorageAccounts",
          "apiVersion": "2020-03-01-preview",
          "properties": {
            "linkedStorageAccount": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageaccount_name'))]"
          }
        }
      ],
      "outputs": {}
    }
    ```

1. Run the following PowerShell command to deploy the preceding template:

    Syntax:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "{your_resource_name}" -TemplateFile "{local_path_to_arm_template}"
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -TemplateFile "D:\Docs\byos.template.json"
    ```

1. Provide the following parameters when you're prompted in the PowerShell console:
  
    |           Parameter           |                                Description                               |
    |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `application_insights_name`     | The name of the Application Insights resource to enable BYOS.            |
    | `storage_account_name`          | The name of the storage account resource that you use as your BYOS. |
  
    Expected output:

    ```powershell
    Supply values for the following parameters:
    (Type !? for Help.)
    application_insights_name: byos-test-westus2-ai
    storage_account_name: byosteststoragewestus2
    
    DeploymentName          : byos.template
    ResourceGroupName      : byos-test
    ProvisioningState       : Succeeded
    Timestamp               : 4/16/2020 1:24:57 AM
    Mode                    : Incremental
    TemplateLink            :
    Parameters              :
                              Name                            Type                       Value
                              ==============================  =========================  ==========
                              application_insights_name        String                     byos-test-westus2-ai
                              storage_account_name             String                     byosteststoragewestus2
                              
    Outputs                 :
    DeploymentDebugLogLevel :
    ```

1. Enable the .NET Profiler or Snapshot Debugger on the workload of interest through the Azure portal. In this example, it's **App Service** > **Application Insights**.

### Scenario: Template schema '{schema_uri}' isn't supported

You received an error similar to the following example:

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment : 11:53:49 AM - Error: Code=InvalidTemplate; Message=Deployment template validation failed: 'Template schema
'https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2020-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#' is not supported. Supported versions are
'2014-04-01-preview,2015-01-01,2018-05-01,2019-04-01,2019-08-01'. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-template for usage details.'.
```

#### Solutions

- Make sure that the `$schema` property of the template is valid. It must follow this pattern:
  ```
  https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/{schema_version}/deploymentTemplate.json#
  ```

- Make sure that the `schema_version` of the template is within valid values: `2014-04-01-preview, 2015-01-01, 2018-05-01, 2019-04-01, 2019-08-01`.
    
### Scenario: No registered resource provider found for location '{location}'

You received an error similar to the following example:

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment : 6:18:03 PM - Resource microsoft.insights/components 'byos-test-westus2-ai' failed with message '{
  "error": {
    "code": "NoRegisteredProviderFound",
    "message": "No registered resource provider found for location 'westus2' and API version '2020-03-01-preview' for type 'components'. The supported api-versions are '2014-04-01,
2014-08-01, 2014-12-01-preview, 2015-05-01, 2018-05-01-preview'. The supported locations are ', eastus, southcentralus, northeurope, westeurope, southeastasia, westus2, uksouth,

australiasoutheast'."
  }
}'
```

#### Solutions

- Make sure that the `apiVersion` of the resource `microsoft.insights/components` is `2015-05-01`.
- Make sure that the `apiVersion` of the resource `linkedStorageAccount` is `2020-03-01-preview`.
    
### Scenario: Storage account location should match Application Insights component location

You received an error similar to the following example:

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment : 1:01:12 PM - Resource microsoft.insights/components/linkedStorageAccounts 'byos-test-centralus-ai/serviceprofiler' failed with message '{
  "error": {
    "code": "BadRequest",
    "message": "Storage account location should match AI component location",
    "innererror": {
      "trace": [
        "System.ArgumentException"
      ]
    }
  }
}'
```

#### Solution

Make sure that the location of the Application Insights resource is the same as the storage account.
    
## Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to common questions about configuring BYOS for .NET Profiler and Snapshot Debugger.

### If I enabled the .NET Profiler/Snapshot Debugger and BYOS, is my data migrated into my storage account?

  No, it won't.

### Does BYOS work with encryption-at-rest and customer-managed keys?
  
  Yes. To be precise, BYOS is a requirement to have the .NET Profiler/Snapshot Debugger enabled with customer-manager keys.

### Does BYOS work in an environment isolated from the internet?
  
  Yes. BYOS is a requirement for isolated network scenarios.

### Does BYOS work with both customer-managed keys and Private Link enabled?
  
  Yes, it's possible.

### If I enabled BYOS, can I go back to using Diagnostic Services storage accounts to store my collected data?
  
  Yes, you can, but we don't currently support data migration from your BYOS.

### After I enable BYOS, do I take over all the related costs of storage and networking?

  Yes. 

### How is my storage account accessed?

1. Agents running in your virtual machines or Azure App Service upload artifacts (profiles, snapshots, and symbols) to blob containers in your account.

    This process involves contacting the .NET Profiler or Snapshot Debugger to obtain a shared access signature token to a new blob in your storage account.

1. The .NET Profiler or Snapshot Debugger:

    - Analyzes the incoming blob.
    - Write back the analysis results and log files into blob storage.
  
    Depending on available compute capacity, this process might occur anytime after upload.

1. When you view Profiler traces or Snapshot Debugger analysis, the service fetches the analysis results from blob storage.
