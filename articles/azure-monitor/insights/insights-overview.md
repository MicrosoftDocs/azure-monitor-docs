# Azure Monitor Insights overview

Some services have a curated monitoring experience. That is, Microsoft provides customized functionality meant to act as a starting point for monitoring those services. These experiences are collectively known as *curated visualizations* with the larger more complex of them being called *Insights*.

The experiences collect and analyze a subset of available telemetry for a given service(s). Depending on the service, the experiences might also provide out-of-the-box alerting. They present the telemetry in a visual layout. The visualizations vary in size and scale.

Some visualizations are considered part of Azure Monitor and follow the support and service level agreements for Azure. They're supported in all Azure regions where Azure Monitor is available. Other curated visualizations provide less functionality, might not scale, and might have different agreements. Some might be based solely on Azure Monitor Workbooks, while others might have an extensive custom experience.

## Insights and curated visualizations

The following table lists the available curated visualizations and information about them. **Most** of the list below can be found in the [Insights hub in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring/AzureMonitoringBrowseBlade/~/more). The table uses the same grouping as portal.

>[!NOTE]
> Another type of older visualization called *monitoring solutions* is no longer in active development. The replacement technology is the Azure Monitor Insights, as mentioned here. We suggest you use the Insights and not deploy new instances of solutions. For more information on the solutions, see [Monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor](solutions.md).
