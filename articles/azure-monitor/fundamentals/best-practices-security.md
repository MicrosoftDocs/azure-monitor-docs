# Azure Monitor security overview and guidelines

This article provides [Security](/azure/architecture/framework/security/) guidelines for Azure Monitor as part of the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/).

Azure Monitor security guidelines help you understand the security features of Azure Monitor and how to configure them to optimize security based on:

* [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/overview), which provides security guidance for teams that manage the technology infrastructure.
* [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/), which provides architectural best practices for building secure applications.
* [Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)](/security/benchmark/azure/overview), which describes the available security features and recommended optimal configurations.
* [Zero Trust security principles](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview), which provides guidance for security teams to implement technical capabilities to support a Zero Trust modernization initiative.

The guidelines in this article build on the [Microsoft security responsibility model](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility). As part of this model of shared responsibility, Microsoft provides these security measures for Azure Monitor customers:

* [Azure infrastructure security](/azure/security/fundamentals/infrastructure)
* [Azure customer data protection](/azure/security/fundamentals/protection-customer-data)
* [Encryption of data in transit during data ingestion](/azure/security/fundamentals/double-encryption#data-in-transit)
* [Encryption of data at rest with Microsoft managed keys](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest#encryption-at-rest-in-microsoft-cloud-services)
* [Microsoft Entra authentication for data plane access](/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-ad-authentication)
* [Authentication of Azure Monitor Agent and Application Insights using managed identities](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
* [Privileged access to data plane actions using Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
* [Compliance with industry standards and regulations](/azure/compliance/offerings)
