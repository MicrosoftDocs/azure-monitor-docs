# Performance efficiency in Azure Monitor

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. Use the following information to monitor the performance of your virtual machines.

This article describes [Performance efficiency](/azure/architecture/framework/security/) for Azure Monitor as part of the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/). The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:

- Reliability
- Security
- Cost Optimization
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency
