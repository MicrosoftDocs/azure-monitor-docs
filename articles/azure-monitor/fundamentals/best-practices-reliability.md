# Reliability best practices in Azure Monitor

In the cloud, we acknowledge that failures happen. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component. Use the following information to monitor your virtual machines and their client workloads for failure.

This article describes [Reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/reliability/) for Azure Monitor as part of the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/). The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:

* Reliability
* Security
* Cost Optimization
* Operational Excellence
* Performance Efficiency
