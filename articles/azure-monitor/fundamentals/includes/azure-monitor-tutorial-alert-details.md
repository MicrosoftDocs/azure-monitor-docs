Select the **Details** tab and configure different settings for the alert rule.

- **Alert rule name** which should be descriptive since it will be displayed when the alert is fired. 
- Optionally provide an **Alert rule description** that's included in the details of the alert.
- **Subscription** and **Resource group** where the alert rule will be stored. This doesn't need to be in the same resource group as the resource that you're monitoring.
- **Severity** for the alert. The severity allows you to group alerts with a similar relative importance. A severity of **Error** is appropriate for an unresponsive virtual machine.
- Under **Advanced options**, keep the box checked to **Enable upon creation**.
- Under **Advanced options**, keep the box checked to **Automatically resolve alerts**. This will make the alert stateful, which means that the alert is resolved when the condition isn't met anymore.
