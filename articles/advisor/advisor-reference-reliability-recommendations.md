## Application Gateway
<!--6a2b1e70-bd4c-4163-86de-5243d7ac05ee_begin-->  
#### Upgrade your SKU or add more instances  
  
Deploying two or more medium or large sized instances ensures business continuity (fault tolerance) during outages caused by planned or unplanned maintenance.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure business continuity through application gateway resilience
  
For More information, see [Multi-region load balancing - Azure Reference Architectures ](https://aka.ms/aa_gatewayrec_learnmore)  

<!--6a2b1e70-bd4c-4163-86de-5243d7ac05ee_end-->

<!--52a9d0a7-efe1-4512-9716-394abd4e0ab1_begin-->  
#### Avoid hostname override to ensure site integrity  
  
Avoid overriding the hostname when configuring Application Gateway. Having a domain on the frontend of Application Gateway different than the one used to access the backend, can lead to broken cookies or redirect URLs. Make sure the backend is able to deal with the domain difference, or update the Application Gateway configuration so the hostname doesn't need to be overwritten towards the backend. When used with App Service, attach a custom domain name to the Web App and avoid use of the *.azurewebsites.net host name towards the backend. Note that a different frontend domain isn't a problem in all situations, and certain categories of backends like REST APIs, are less sensitive in general.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure site integrity and avoid broken cookies or redirect urls through a resilient Application Gateway configuration.
  
For More information, see [Troubleshoot App Service issues in Application Gateway](https://aka.ms/appgw-advisor-usecustomdomain)  

<!--52a9d0a7-efe1-4512-9716-394abd4e0ab1_end-->
  

<!--17454550-1543-4068-bdaf-f3ed7cdd3d86_begin-->  
#### Implement ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance Monitor  
  
When ExpressRoute circuit isn't monitored by ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance, you miss notifications of loss, latency, and performance of on-premises to Azure resources, and Azure to on-premises resources. For end-to-end monitoring, implement ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve time-to-detect and time-to-mitigate issues in your network and provide insights on your network path via ExpressRoute
  
For More information, see [Configure Network Performance Monitor for ExpressRoute (deprecated)](/azure/expressroute/how-to-npm)  

<!--17454550-1543-4068-bdaf-f3ed7cdd3d86_end-->
  

<!--70f87e66-9b2d-4bfa-ae38-1d7d74837689_begin-->  
#### Implement multiple ExpressRoute circuits in your Virtual Network for cross premises resiliency  
  
When an ExpressRoute gateway only has one ExpressRoute circuit associated to it, resiliency issues might occur. To ensure peering location redundancy and resiliency, connect one or more additional circuits to your gateway.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve resiliency in case of ExpressRoute peering location failure
  
For More information, see [Designing for high availability with ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/designing-for-high-availability-with-expressroute)  

<!--70f87e66-9b2d-4bfa-ae38-1d7d74837689_end-->
  

<!--6cd70072-c45c-4716-bf7b-b35c18e46e72_begin-->  
#### Add at least one more endpoint to the profile, preferably in another Azure region  
  
Profiles need more than one endpoint to ensure availability if one of the endpoints fails. We also recommend that endpoints be in different regions.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve resiliency by allowing failover
  
For More information, see [Traffic Manager endpoints](https://aka.ms/AA1o0x4)  

<!--6cd70072-c45c-4716-bf7b-b35c18e46e72_end-->
  

<!--0bbe0a49-3c63-49d3-ab4a-aa24198f03f7_begin-->  
#### Add an endpoint configured to "All (World)"  
  
For geographic routing, traffic is routed to endpoints in defined regions. When a region fails, there is no pre-defined failover. Having an endpoint where the Regional Grouping is configured to "All (World)" for geographic profiles avoids traffic black holing and guarantees service availablity.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve resiliency by avoiding traffic black holes
  
For More information, see [Add, disable, enable, delete, or move endpoints](https://aka.ms/Rf7vc5)  

<!--0bbe0a49-3c63-49d3-ab4a-aa24198f03f7_end-->
  

<!--0db76759-6d22-4262-93f0-2f989ba2b58e_begin-->  
#### Add or move one endpoint to another Azure region  
  
All endpoints associated to this proximity profile are in the same region. Users from other regions may experience long latency when attempting to connect. Adding or moving an endpoint to another region will improve overall performance for proximity routing and provide better availability if all endpoints in one region fail.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve resiliency by allowing failover to another region
  
For More information, see [Configure the performance traffic routing method](https://aka.ms/Ldkkdb)  

<!--0db76759-6d22-4262-93f0-2f989ba2b58e_end-->
  

<!--e070c4bf-afaf-413e-bc00-e476b89c5f3d_begin-->  
#### Move to production gateway SKUs from Basic gateways  
  
The Basic VPN SKU is for development or testing scenarios. If you're using the VPN gateway for production, move to a production SKU, which offers higher numbers of tunnels, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), active-active configuration, custom IPsec/IKE policy, and increased stability and availability.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Additional available features and higher stability and availability
  
For More information, see [About VPN Gateway configuration settings](https://aka.ms/aa_basicvpngateway_learnmore)  

<!--e070c4bf-afaf-413e-bc00-e476b89c5f3d_end-->
  

<!--c249dc0e-9a17-423e-838a-d72719e8c5dd_begin-->  
#### Enable Active-Active gateways for redundancy  
  
In active-active configuration, both instances of the VPN gateway establish site-to-site (S2S) VPN tunnels to your on-premise VPN device. When a planned maintenance or unplanned event happens to one gateway instance, traffic is automatically switched over to the other active IPsec tunnel.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure business continuity through connection resilience
  
For More information, see [Design highly available gateway connectivity for cross-premises and VNet-to-VNet connections](https://aka.ms/aa_vpnha_learnmore)

<!--1c7fc5ab-f776-4aee-8236-ab478519f68f_begin-->  
#### Disable health probes when there is only one origin in an origin group  
  
If you only have a single origin, Front Door always routes traffic to that origin even if its health probe reports an unhealthy status. The status of the health probe doesn't do anything to change Front Door's behavior. In this scenario, health probes don't provide a benefit.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure service availability by reducing unnecessary health probe traffic
  
For More information, see [Best practices for Front Door](https://aka.ms/afd-disable-health-probes)  

<!--1c7fc5ab-f776-4aee-8236-ab478519f68f_end-->
  

<!--5185d64e-46fd-4ed2-8633-6d81f5e3ca59_begin-->  
#### Use managed TLS certificates  
  
When Front Door manages your TLS certificates, it reduces your operational costs, and helps you to avoid costly outages caused by forgetting to renew a certificate. Front Door automatically issues and rotates the managed TLS certificates.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure service availability by having Front Door manage and rotate your certificates
  
For More information, see [Best practices for Front Door](https://aka.ms/afd-use-managed-tls)  

<!--5185d64e-46fd-4ed2-8633-6d81f5e3ca59_end-->
  

<!--56f0c458-521d-4b8b-a704-c0a099483d19_begin-->  
#### Use NAT gateway for outbound connectivity  
  
Prevent connectivity failures due to source network address translation (SNAT) port exhaustion by using NAT gateway for outbound traffic from your virtual networks. NAT gateway scales dynamically and provides secure connections for traffic headed to the internet.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Prevent outbound connection failures with NAT gateway
  
For More information, see [Use Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections#2-associate-a-nat-gateway-to-the-subnet)

<!--6cc8be07-8c03-4bd7-ad9b-c2985b261e01_begin-->  
#### Update VNet permission of Application Gateway users  
  
To improve security and provide a more consistent experience across Azure, all users must pass a permission check to create or update an Application Gateway in a Virtual Network. The users or service principals minimum permission required is Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Avoid disruptions in management of Application Gateway resource
  
For More information, see [Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](https://aka.ms/agsubnetjoin)

<!--79f543f9-60e6-4ef6-ae42-2095f6149cba_begin-->  
#### Use the same domain name on Front Door and your origin  
  
When you rewrite the Host header, request cookies and URL redirections might break. When you use platforms like Azure App Service, features like session affinity and authentication and authorization might not work correctly.

#### Implement Site Resiliency for ExpressRoute  
  
To ensure maximum resiliency, Microsoft recommends that you connect to two ExpressRoute circuits in two peering locations. The goal of Maximum Resiliency is to enhance availability and ensure the highest level of resilience for critical workloads.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Maximum Resiliency in ExpressRoute is designed to ensure there isn’t a single point of failure within the Microsoft network path. This is achieved by offering dual (2) circuits across two different locations for site diversity in ExpressRoute. The goal of Maximum Resiliency is to enhance availability and ensure the highest level of resilience for critical workloads.

#### Check linked Azure Key Vault hosting your encryption key  
  
When an Azure Cosmos DB account can't access its linked Azure Key Vault hosting the encyrption key, data access and security issues might happen. Your Azure Key Vault's configuration is preventing your Cosmos DB account from contacting the key vault to access your managed encryption keys. If you  recently performed a key rotation, ensure that the previous key, or key version, remains enabled and available until Cosmos DB completes the rotation. The previous key or key version can be disabled after 24 hours, or after the Azure Key Vault audit logs don't show any activity from Azure Cosmos DB on that key or key version.

#### High Availability - Add primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one.  
  
Our internal monitoring system has identified significant replication lag on the High Availability standby server. This lag is primarily caused by the standby server replaying relay logs on a table that lacks a primary key. To address this issue and adhere to best practices, it's recommended to add primary keys to all tables. Once this is done, proceed to disable and then re-enable High Availability to mitigate the problem.  
  
**Potential benefits**: By implementing this approach, the standby server will be shielded from the adverse effects of high replication lag caused by the absence of a primary key on any table. This approach can contribute to reduced failover times, ultimately supporting the goal of maintaining business continuity.

#### Replication - Add a primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one  
  
Our internal monitoring observed significant replication lag on your replica server  because the replica server is replaying relay logs on a table that lacks a primary key. To ensure that the replica server can effectively synchronize with the primary and keep up with changes, add primary keys to the tables in the primary server and then recreate the replica server.  
  
**Potential benefits**: By implementing this approach, the replica server will achieve a state of close synchronization with the primary server.

#### Upgrade the standard disks attached to your premium-capable VM to premium disks  
  
Using Standard SSD disks with premium VMs may lead to suboptimal performance and latency issues. We recommend that you consider upgrading the standard disks to premium disks. For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using premium storage for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 99.9%. When choosing to upgrade, there are two factors to consider. The first factor is that upgrading requires a VM reboot and that takes 3-5 minutes to complete. The second is if the VMs in the list are mission-critical production VMs, evaluate the improved availability against the cost of premium disks.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved availability with single VM SLA available only when all disks are premium

#### Align location of resource and resource group  
  
To reduce the impact of region outages, co-locate your resources with their resource group in the same region. This way, Azure Resource Manager stores metadata related to all resources within the group in one region. By co-locating, you reduce the chance of being affected by region unavailability.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Reduce write failures due to region outages

#### Use Availability zones for better resiliency and availability  
  
Availability Zones (AZ) in Azure help protect your applications and data from datacenter failures. Each AZ is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. By designing solutions to use zonal VMs, you can isolate your VMs from failure in any other zone.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Usage of zonal VMs protect your apps from zonal outage in any other zones.
