### Navigating the workbook

Workbook offers a set of filters that you can use to scope recommendation for a specific application.

*    Subscription
*    Resource Group
*    Environment 
*    Tags 

The workbook uses tags with names Environment, environment, Env, env and common keywords (prod, dev, qa, uat, sit, test) as part of resource name to show environment for a specific resource. If there are no tags or naming conventions detected, the environment filter is displayed as 'undefined'. The 'undefined' value is shown only within the workbook and is not used anywhere else.

Use **SLA** and **Help** controls to show additional information:

*    Show SLA - Displays the service SLA. 
*    Show Help - Displays best practice configurations to increase the reliability of the resource deployment.

The workbook offers best practices for Azure services including:
*    **Compute**: Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets
*    **Containers**: Azure Kubernetes service
*    **Databases**: SQL Database, Synapse SQL Pool, Cosmos DB, Azure Database for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Azure Cache for Redis
*    **Integration**: Azure API Management

*    **Storage**: Storage Account
*    **Web**: App Service Plan, App Service, Function App

To share the findings with your team, you can export data for each of the services or share the workbook link with them.
