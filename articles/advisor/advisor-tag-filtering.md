# Review optimization opportunities by workload, environment, or team

You can now get Advisor recommendations and scores scoped to a workload, environment, or team  using resource tag filters. Filter recommendations and calculate scores using tags you already assigned to Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions. Use tag filters to:

* Identify cost saving opportunities by team
* Compare scores for workloads to optimize the critical ones first

> [!TIP]
> For more information on how to use resource tags to organize and govern your Azure resources, please see the [Cloud Adoption Frameworkâ€™s guidance](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging) and [Build a cloud governance strategy on Azure](/training/modules/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/).
