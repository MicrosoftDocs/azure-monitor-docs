### Injecting a cache into a virtual network (VNet) imposes complex requirements on your network configuration, which is a common source of incidents affecting customer applications

Injecting a cache into a virtual network (VNet) imposes complex requirements on your network configuration. It's difficult to configure the network accurately and avoid affecting cache functionality. It's easy to break the cache accidentally while making configuration changes for other network resources, which is a common source of incidents affecting customer applications

Learn more about [Redis Cache Server - PrivateLink (Injecting a cache into a virtual network (VNet) imposes complex requirements on your network configuration. This is a common source of incidents affecting customer applications)](https://aka.ms/VnetToPrivateLink).

### Support for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 is retiring on September 30, 2024

Support for TLS 1.0/1.1 is retiring on September 30, 2024. Configure your cache to use TLS 1.2 only and your application to use TLS 1.2 or later. See https://aka.ms/TLSVersions for more information.

Learn more about [Redis Cache Server - TLSVersion (Support for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 is retiring on September 30, 2024.)](https://aka.ms/TLSVersions).

### Cloud service caches are being retired in August 2024, migrate before then to avoid any problems

This instance of Azure Cache for Redis has a dependency on Cloud Services (classic) which is being retired in August 2024. Follow the instructions found in the following link to migrate to an instance without this dependency. If you need to upgrade your cache to Redis 6  note that upgrading a cache with a dependency on cloud services isn't supported. You must migrate your cache instance to Virtual Machine Scale Set before upgrading. For more information, see the following link. Note: If you have completed your migration away from Cloud Services,  allow up to 24 hours for this recommendation to be removed

Learn more about [Redis Cache Server - MigrateFromCloudService (Cloud service caches are being retired in August 2024, migrate before then to avoid any problems)](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-faq#caches-with-a-dependency-on-cloud-services-%28classic%29).

### Redis persistence allows you to persist data stored in a cache so you can reload data from an event that caused data loss.

Redis persistence allows you to persist data stored in Redis. You can also take snapshots and back up the data. If there's a hardware failure, the persisted data is automatically loaded in your cache instance.  Data loss is possible if a failure occurs where Cache nodes are down.

Learn more about [Redis Cache Server - Persistence (Redis persistence allows you to persist data stored in a cache so you can reload data from an event that caused data loss.)](https://aka.ms/redis/persistence).

### Using persistence with soft delete enabled can increase storage costs.

Check to see if your storage account has soft delete enabled before using the data persistence feature. Using data persistence with soft delete causes very high storage costs. For more information, see the following link.

Learn more about [Redis Cache Server - PersistenceSoftEnable (Using persistence with soft delete enabled can increase storage costs.)](https://aka.ms/redis/persistence).

### You might benefit from using an Enterprise tier cache instance

This instance of Azure Cache for Redis is using one or more advanced features from the list - more than 6 shards, geo-replication, zone-redundancy or persistence. Consider switching to an Enterprise tier cache to get the most out of your Redis experience. Enterprise tier caches offer higher availability, better performance and more powerful features like active geo-replication.

## Integration

### Use Azure AD-based authentication for more fine-grained control and simplified management

You can use Azure AD-based authentication, instead of gateway tokens, which allows you to use standard procedures to create, assign and manage permissions and control expiry times. Additionally, you gain fine-grained control across gateway deployments and easily revoke access in case of a breach.

Learn more about [Api Management - ShgwUseAdAuth (Use Azure AD-based authentication for more fine-grained control and simplified management)](https://aka.ms/apim/shgw/how-to/use-ad-auth).

### Validate JWT policy is being used with security keys that have insecure key size for validating Json Web Token (JWT).

### Only allow tracing on subscriptions intended for debugging purposes. Sharing subscription keys with tracing allowed with unauthorized users could lead to disclosure of sensitive information contained in tracing logs such as keys, access tokens, passwords, internal hostnames, and IP addresses.

Traces generated by Azure API Management service might contain sensitive information that is intended for service owner and must not be exposed to clients using the service. Using tracing enabled subscription keys in production or automated scenarios creates a risk of sensitive information exposure if client making call to the service requests a trace.

Learn more about [Api Management - heavy-tracing-usage (Only allow tracing on subscriptions intended for debugging purposes. Sharing subscription keys with tracing allowed with unauthorized users could lead to disclosure of sensitive information contained in tracing logs such as keys, access tokens, passwords, internal hostnames, and IP addresses.)](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-api-inspector).

### Self-hosted gateway instances were identified that use gateway tokens that expire soon

At least one deployed self-hosted gateway instance was identified that uses a gateway token that expires in the next seven days. To ensure that it can connect to the control-plane, generate a new gateway token and update your deployed self-hosted gateways  (does not impact data-plane traffic).

### Update to newer releases of the Storage Java v12 SDK for better reliability.

We noticed that one or more of your applications use an older version of the Azure Storage Java v12 SDK to write data to Azure Storage. Unfortunately, the version of the SDK being used has a critical issue that uploads incorrect data during retries (for example, in case of HTTP 500 errors), resulting in an invalid object being written. The issue is fixed in newer releases of the Java v12 SDK.

## Virtual desktop infrastructure

### Permissions missing for start VM on connect

We have determined you enabled start VM on connect but didn't grant the Azure Virtual Desktop the rights to power manage VMs in your subscription. As a result your users connecting to host pools won't receive a remote desktop session. Review feature documentation for requirements.

Learn more about [Host Pool - AVDStartVMonConnect (Permissions missing for start VM on connect)](https://aka.ms/AVDStartVMRequirement).

### No validation environment enabled

We have determined that you do not have a validation environment enabled in current subscription. When creating your host pools, you have selected "No" for "Validation environment" in the properties tab. Having at least one host pool with a validation environment enabled ensures the business continuity through Azure Virtual Desktop service deployments with early detection of potential issues.

Learn more about [Host Pool - ValidationEnvHostPools (No validation environment enabled)](/azure/virtual-desktop/create-validation-host-pool).

### Not enough production environments enabled

We have determined that too many of your host pools have Validation Environment enabled. In order for Validation Environments to best serve their purpose, you must have at least one, but never more than half of your host pools in Validation Environment. By having a healthy balance between your host pools with Validation Environment enabled and those with it disabled, you're best able to utilize the benefits of the multistage deployments that Azure Virtual Desktop offers with certain updates. To fix this issue, open your host pool's properties and select "No" next to the "Validation Environment" setting.
