## Key Vault

<!--9017e82f-b7ac-4a06-8b9b-5858cb3d5113_begin-->

#### Upgrade the Azure Key Vault SDK to the latest version  
  
New Key Vault libraries split keys, secrets, and certificates into separate SDKs with Azure Identity integration for seamless auth and performance improvements. DISMISS: If using Key Vault with Azure Storage, Disk, or other services, and all custom apps that use .NET SDK 4.0+.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Fixes for known issues and other improvements.  

**Impact:** Medium
