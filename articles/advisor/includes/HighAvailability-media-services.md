## Media Services

#### Increase Media Services quotas or limits  
  
When a media account hits its quota limits, disruption of service might occur. To avoid any disruption of service, review current usage of assets, content key policies, and stream policies and increase quota limits for the entities that are close to hitting the limit. You can request quota limits be increased by opening a ticket and adding relevant details. TIP: Don't create additional Azure Media accounts in an attempt to obtain higher limits.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Avoid any disruption to service due to customer exceeding quota limits.  

**Impact:** Medium
