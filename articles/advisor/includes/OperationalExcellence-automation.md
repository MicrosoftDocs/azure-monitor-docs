#### Move to Azure Update Manager as Automation Update Management will be deprecated by 31st Aug 2024  
  
Azure Update Manager is a unified service to manage and govern updates for all your machines on Azure, on-premises and in other cloud environments. It's an evolution of Automation Update Management solution which depends on Log Analytics solution, both of which will be deprecated by 31st Aug 2024.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Use a more secure and advanced patching solution  

**Impact:** High
