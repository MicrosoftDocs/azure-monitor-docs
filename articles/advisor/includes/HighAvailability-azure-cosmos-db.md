## Azure Cosmos DB  
  
<!--5e4e9f04-9201-4fd9-8af6-a9539d13d8ec_begin-->

#### Configure Azure Cosmos DB containers with a partition key  
  
When Azure Cosmos DB nonpartitioned collections reach their provisioned storage quota, you lose the ability to add data. Your Cosmos DB nonpartitioned collections are approaching their provisioned storage quota. Migrate these collections to new collections with a partition key definition so they can automatically be scaled out by the service.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Scale your containers seamlessly with increase in storage or request rates without running into any limits  

**Impact:** High
  
For more information, see [Partitioning and horizontal scaling - Azure Cosmos DB ](/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#choose-partitionkey)

#### Use static Cosmos DB client instances in your code and cache the names of databases and collections  
  
A high number of metadata operations on an account can result in rate limiting. Metadata operations have a system-reserved request unit (RU) limit. Avoid rate limiting from metadata operations by using static Cosmos DB client instances in your code and caching the names of databases and collections.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Optimize your RU usage and avoid rate limiting  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Check linked Azure Key Vault hosting your encryption key  
  
When an Azure Cosmos DB account can't access its linked Azure Key Vault hosting the encyrption key, data access and security issues might happen. Your Azure Key Vault's configuration is preventing your Cosmos DB account from contacting the key vault to access your managed encryption keys. If you  recently performed a key rotation, ensure that the previous key, or key version, remains enabled and available until Cosmos DB completes the rotation. The previous key or key version can be disabled after 24 hours, or after the Azure Key Vault audit logs don't show any activity from Azure Cosmos DB on that key or key version.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Update your configurations to continue using customer-managed keys and access your data  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Configure consistent indexing mode on Azure Cosmos DB containers  
  
Azure Cosmos containers configured with the Lazy indexing mode update asynchronously, which improves write performance, but can impact query freshness. Your container is configured with the Lazy indexing mode. If query freshness is critical, use Consistent Indexing Mode for immediate index updates.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve query result consistency and reliability

#### Hotfix - Upgrade to 2.6.14 version of the Async Java SDK v2 or to Java SDK v4  
  
There's a critical bug in version 2.6.13 (and lower) of the Azure Cosmos DB Async Java SDK v2 causing errors when a Global logical sequence number (LSN) greater than the Max Integer value is reached. The error happens transparently to you by the service after a large volume of transactions occur in the lifetime of an Azure Cosmos DB container. Note: While this is a critical hotfix for the Async Java SDK v2, we still highly recommend you migrate to the [Java SDK v4](/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-java-v4).  
  
**Potential benefits**: If action isn’t taken, all create, read, update, and delete operations may begin to fail with NumberFormatException  

**Impact:** High

#### Critical issue - Upgrade to the current recommended version of the Java SDK v4  
  
There's a critical bug in version 4.15 and lower of the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4 causing errors when a Global logical sequence number (LSN) greater than the Max Integer value is reached. This happens transparently to you by the service after a large volume of transactions occur in the lifetime of an Azure Cosmos DB container. Avoid this problem by upgrading to the current recommended version of the Java SDK v4

#### Use the new 3.6+ endpoint to connect to your upgraded Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB account  
  
Some of your applications are connecting to your upgraded Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB account using the legacy 3.2 endpoint - [accountname].documents.azure.com. Use the new endpoint - [accountname].mongo.cosmos.azure.com (or its equivalent in sovereign, government, or restricted clouds).  
  
**Potential benefits**: Take advantage of the latest features in version 3.6+ of Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB

#### Upgrade your Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB account to v4.2 to save on query/storage costs and utilize new features  
  
Your Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB account is eligible to upgrade to version 4.2. Upgrading to v4.2 can reduce your storage costs by up to 55% and your query costs by up to 45% by leveraging a new storage format. Numerous additional features such as multi-document transactions are also included in v4.2.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved reliability, query/storage efficiency, performance, and new feature capabilities

#### Enable Server Side Retry (SSR) on your Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB account  
  
When an account is throwing a TooManyRequests error with the 16500 error code, enabling Server Side Retry (SSR) can help mitigate the issue.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Prevent throttling and improve your query reliability and performance  

**Impact:** High

#### Add a second region to your production workloads on Azure Cosmos DB  
  
Production workloads on Azure Cosmos DB run in a single region might have availability issues, this appears to be the case with some of your Cosmos DB accounts. Increase their availability by configuring them to span at least two Azure regions. NOTE: Additional regions incur additional costs.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improve the availability of your production workloads

#### Enable service managed failover for Cosmos DB account  
  
Enable service managed failover for Cosmos DB account to ensure high availability of the account. Service managed failover automatically switches the write region to the secondary region in case of a primary region outage. This ensures that the application continues to function without any downtime.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Azure's Service-Managed Failover feature enhances system availability by automating failover processes, reducing downtime, and improving resilience.

#### Enable HA for your Production workload  
  
Many clusters with consistent workloads do not have high availability (HA) enabled. It's recommended to activate HA from the Scale page in the Azure Portal to prevent database downtime in case of unexpected node failures and to qualify for SLA guarantees.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Activate HA to avoid database downtime in case of an unexpected node failure

#### Enable zone redundancy for multi-region Cosmos DB accounts  
  
This recommendation suggests enabling zone redundancy for multi-region Cosmos DB accounts to improve high availability and reduce the risk of data loss in case of a regional outage.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved high availability and reduced risk of data loss

#### Add at least one data center in another Azure region  
  
Your Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster is designated as a production cluster but is currently deployed in a single Azure region. For production clusters, we recommend adding at least one more data center in another Azure region to guard against disaster recovery scenarios.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure applications have another region in case of disaster recovery

#### Avoid being rate limited for Control Plane operation  
  
We found high number of Control Plane operations on your account through resource provider. Request that exceeds the documented limits at sustained levels over consecutive 5-minute periods may experience request being throttling as well failed or incomplete operation on Azure Cosmos DB resources.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Optimize control plane operation and avoid operation failure due to rate limiting
