#### Migrate Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (Classic) to Azure Front Door Standard/Premium tier  
  
Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) is scheduled for retirement on 30 September 2027. We encourage you to use the zero downtime migration tool to transition to Front Door Standard and Premium SKUs. These options offer not only feature parity but also additional features and enhanced security  
  
**Potential benefits**: Avoid potential disruptions and leverage new capabilities  

**Impact:** Medium
