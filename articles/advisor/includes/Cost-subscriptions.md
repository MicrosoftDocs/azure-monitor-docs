#### Use Virtual Machines with Ephemeral OS Disk enabled to save cost and get better performance  
  
With Ephemeral OS Disk, Customers get these benefits: Save on storage cost for OS disk. Get lower read/write latency to OS disk. Faster VM Reimage operation by resetting OS (and Temporary disk) to its original state. It's more preferable to use Ephemeral OS Disk for short-lived IaaS VMs or VMs with stateless workloads.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Reduced storage cost, lower read/write latency, faster reimage operation for OS disk. More preferable for short-lived IaaS VMs or VMs with stateless workloads  

**Impact:** Medium
