#### Consider using multiple endpoints under one single Front Door Standard/Premium profile  
  
We detected your subscription contains multiple Front Door Standard/Premium profiles with a small number of endpoints on them. You can save costs in base fees by using multiple endpoints within one profile. You can use a maximum of 10 endpoints with Standard tier and 25 endpoints with Premium tier.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Save costs  

**Impact:** Medium
