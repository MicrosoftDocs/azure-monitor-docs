#### Avoid hostname override to ensure site integrity  
  
Avoid overriding the hostname when configuring Application Gateway. Having a domain on the frontend of Application Gateway different than the one used to access the backend, can lead to broken cookies or redirect URLs. Make sure the backend is able to deal with the domain difference, or update the Application Gateway configuration so the hostname doesn't need to be overwritten towards the backend. When used with App Service, attach a custom domain name to the Web App and avoid use of the *.azurewebsites.net host name towards the backend. Note that a different frontend domain isn't a problem in all situations, and certain categories of backends like REST APIs, are less sensitive in general.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure site integrity and avoid broken cookies or redirect urls through a resilient Application Gateway configuration.  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Use version-less Key Vault secret identifier to reference the certificates  
  
To allow your application gateway resource to automatically retrieve a new certificate version, we strongly recommend using a version-less secret identifier, whenever available. For example: https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure auto-rotation for new certificate versions  

**Impact:** High
