## Virtual Machines

#### You have disks that aren't attached to a VM. Evaluate if you still need the disk  
  
We have observed that you have disks that aren't attached to a VM. Evaluate if you still need the disk. If you decide to delete the disk, recovery isn't possible. We recommend that you create a snapshot before deletion or ensure the data in the disk is no longer required.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Cost saving.  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Standard SSD disks billing caps  
  
Customers running high IO workloads in Standard HDDs can upgrade to Standard SSDs and benefit from better performance and SLA and now experience a limit on the maximum number of billed transactions.  
  
**Potential benefits**: If your workload demands high IO, upgrade to Standard SSDs to enjoy better performance and save costs.  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Use Standard Storage to store Managed Disks snapshots  
  
To save 60% of cost, we recommend storing your snapshots in Standard Storage, regardless of the storage type of the parent disk. This option is the default for Managed Disks snapshots. Migrate your snapshot from Premium to Standard Storage. Refer to Managed Disks pricing details.  
  
**Potential benefits**: 60% reduction in the snapshot cost for Managed Disks  

**Impact:** High

#### Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines  
  
We've analyzed the usage patterns of your virtual machine and identified virtual machines with low usage. While certain scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by managing the size and number of virtual machines.  
  
**Potential benefits**: savings  

**Impact:** High

#### Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machine scale sets  
  
We've analyzed the usage patterns of your virtual machine scale sets over the past 7 days and identified virtual machine scale sets with low usage. While certain scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by managing the size and number of virtual machine scale sets.
