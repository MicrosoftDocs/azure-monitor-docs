#### Upgrade Application Configuration Service to Gen 2  
  
We notice you are still using Application Configuration Service Gen1 which will be end of support by April 2024. Application Configuration Service Gen2 provides better performance compared to Gen1 and the upgrade from Gen1 to Gen2 is zero downtime so we recommend to upgrade as soon as possible.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Higher stability and availability  

**Impact:** Medium
