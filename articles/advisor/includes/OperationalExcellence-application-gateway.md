#### Enable Traffic Analytics to view insights into traffic patterns across Azure resources  
  
Traffic Analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in Azure. Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow. With traffic analytics, you can view top talkers across Azure and non Azure deployments, investigate open ports, protocols and malicious flows in your environment and optimize your network deployment for performance. You can process flow logs at 10 mins and 60 mins processing intervals, giving you faster analytics on your traffic.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Identify top talkers, traffic hotspots, resource utilisation and security based on traffic patterns in NSG
