## HDInsight  
  
<!--69740e3e-5b96-4b0e-b9b8-4d7573e3611c_begin-->

#### Apply critical updates by dropping and recreating your HDInsight clusters (certificate rotation round 2)  
  
The HDInsight service attempted to apply a critical certificate update on your running clusters. However, due to some custom configuration changes, we're unable to apply the updates on all clusters. To prevent those clusters from becoming unhealthy and unusable, drop and recreate your clusters.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure cluster health and stability

#### Non-ESP ABFS clusters [Cluster Permissions for Word Readable]  
  
Plan to introduce a change in non-ESP ABFS clusters, which restricts non-Hadoop group users from running Hadoop commands for storage operations. This change is to improve cluster security posture. Customers need to plan for the updates before September 30, 2023.  
  
**Potential benefits**: This change is to improve cluster security posture

#### Restart brokers on your Kafka Cluster Disks  
  
When data disks used by Kafka brokers in  HDInsight clusters are almost full, the Apache Kafka broker process can't start and fails. To mitigate, find the retention time for every topic, back up the files that are older, and restart the brokers.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Avoid Kafka broker issues  

For more information, see [Scenario: Brokers are unhealthy or can't restart due to disk space full issue](https://aka.ms/kafka-troubleshoot-full-disk)

#### Cluster Name length update  
  
The max length of cluster name will be changed to 45 from 59 characters, to improve the security posture of clusters. This change will be implemented by September 30th, 2023.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Security posture improvement for HDInsight

#### Upgrade your cluster to the the latest HDInsight image  
  
A cluster created one year ago doesn't have the latest image upgrades. Your cluster was created 1 year ago. As part of the best practices, we recommend you use the latest HDInsight images for the best open source updates, Azure updates, and security fixes. The recommended maximum duration for cluster upgrades is less than six months.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Get the latest fixes and features  

For more information, see [Consider the below points before starting to create a cluster.](/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-overview-before-you-start#keep-your-clusters-up-to-date)

<!--97355d8e-59ae-43ff-9214-d4acf728467a_begin-->

#### Upgrade your HDInsight Cluster  
  
A cluster not using the latest image doesn't have the latest upgrades. Your cluster isn't using the latest image. We recommend you use the latest versions of HDInsight images for the best of open source updates, Azure updates, and security fixes. HDInsight releases happen every 30 to 60 days.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Get the latest fixes and features

#### Gateway or virtual machine not reachable  
  
We have detected a Network prob failure, it indicates unreachable gateway or a virtual machine. Verify all cluster hostsâ€™ availability.  Restart virtual machine to recover. If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to contact Azure support for help.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved availability

#### VM agent is 9.9.9.9. Upgrade the cluster.  
  
Our records indicate that one or more of your clusters are using images dated February 2022 or older (image versions 2202xxxxxx or older). 
There is a potential reliability issue on HDInsight clusters that use images dated February 2022 or older.Consider rebuilding your clusters with latest image.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved Reliability in Scaling and Network connectivity
