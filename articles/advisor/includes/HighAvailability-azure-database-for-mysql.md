#### High Availability - Add primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one.  
  
Our internal monitoring system has identified significant replication lag on the High Availability standby server. This lag is primarily caused by the standby server replaying relay logs on a table that lacks a primary key. To address this issue and adhere to best practices, it's recommended to add primary keys to all tables. Once this is done, proceed to disable and then re-enable High Availability to mitigate the problem.  
  
**Potential benefits**: By implementing this approach, the standby server will be shielded from the adverse effects of high replication lag caused by the absence of a primary key on any table. This approach can contribute to reduced failover times, ultimately supporting the goal of maintaining business continuity.  

**Impact:** High

#### Replication - Add a primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one  
  
Our internal monitoring observed significant replication lag on your replica server  because the replica server is replaying relay logs on a table that lacks a primary key. To ensure that the replica server can effectively synchronize with the primary and keep up with changes, add primary keys to the tables in the primary server and then recreate the replica server.  
  
**Potential benefits**: By implementing this approach, the replica server will achieve a state of close synchronization with the primary server.  

**Impact:** High

#### Scale replica server's SKU to match the source server SKU  
  
The replica server is experiencing replication lag. This is due to the replica server's SKU being smaller than the source server SKU. To ensure smooth replication, we recommend scaling up the SKU of your replica server.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Keeps replication lag in check.  

**Impact:** High

#### Upgrade to Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2  
  
Upgrade to Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 from TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 for the application. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 were deprecated in March 2021.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved security. Compliance with newest standards.  

**Impact:** High
