## App Service Certificates  
  
<!--a2385343-200c-4eba-bbe2-9252d3f1d6ea_begin-->

#### Domain verification required to issue your App Service Certificate  
  
You have an App Service Certificate that's currently in a Pending Issuance status and requires domain verification. Failure to validate domain ownership will result in an unsuccessful certificate issuance. Domain verification isn't automated for App Service Certificates and will require action. If you've recently verified domain ownership and have been issued a certificate, you may disregard this message.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure successful issuance of App Service Certificate.  

**Impact:** High
