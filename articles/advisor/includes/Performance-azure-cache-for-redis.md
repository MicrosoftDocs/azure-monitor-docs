## Azure Cache for Redis

#### Improve your Cache and application performance when running with many connected clients  
  
Cache instances perform best when not running under high server load which may cause them to become unresponsive, experience data loss, or become unavailable. Apply best practices to reduce the server load or scale to a different size or sku with more capacity.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure optimal performance and high availability through best practices  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Cache instances perform best when the host machines where client application runs is able to keep up with responses from the cache  
  
Cache instances perform best when the host machines where client application runs is able to keep up with responses from the cache. If client host machine is running hot on memory, CPU, or network bandwidth, the cache responses will not reach your application fast enough and could result in higher latency.  
  
**Potential benefits**: You can improve your cache throughput and latency.  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Improve your Cache and application performance when running with high memory pressure  
  
Cache instances perform best when not running under high memory pressure which may cause them to become unresponsive, experience data loss, or become unavailable. Apply best practices to reduce used memory or scale to a different size or sku with more capacity.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure optimal performance and high availability through best practices
