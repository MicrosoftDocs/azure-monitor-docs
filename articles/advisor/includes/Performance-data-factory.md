## Data Factory  
  
<!--eb4f67d2-2440-4d58-bec7-6de73cc5ba75_begin-->

#### Review your throttled Data Factory Triggers  
  
A high volume of throttling is detected in an event-based trigger that runs in your Data Factory resource. This is causing your pipeline runs to drop from the run queue. Review the trigger definition to resolve issues and increase performance.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure better performance by reviewing and editing your event-based trigger definition  

**Impact:** Medium
