## Azure Database for MySQL  
  
<!--7e76e54f-7978-4d48-9ab9-a4da5b7c69a3_begin-->

#### Right-size underutilized MySQL servers  
  
Our internal telemetry shows that the MySQL database server resources have been underutilized for an extended period of time over the last 7 days. Low resource utilization results in unwanted expenditure which can be fixed without significant performance impact. To reduce your costs and efficiently manage your resources, we recommend reducing the compute size (vCores) by half.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Reduce cost by right-sizing the MySQL server  

**Impact:** Medium
