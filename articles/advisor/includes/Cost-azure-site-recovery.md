## Azure Site Recovery  
  
<!--83cf9b6e-1b82-4a1d-9151-7581dda7a26e_begin-->

#### Use differential or incremental backup for database workloads  
  
For SQL/HANA DBs in Azure VMs being backed up to Azure, using daily differential with weekly full backup is often more cost-effective than daily fully backups. For HANA, Azure Backup also supports incremental backup which is even more cost effective.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Optimize costs without impacting RPO  

**Impact:** Medium
