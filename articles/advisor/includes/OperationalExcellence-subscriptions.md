#### Set up staging environments in Azure App Service  
  
Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, no requests are dropped because of swap operations.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Validate changes in a staging slot, then swap to production.  

**Impact:** Low
