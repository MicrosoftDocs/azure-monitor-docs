## API Management

#### Only allow tracing on subscriptions intended for debugging purposes. Sharing subscription keys with tracing allowed with unauthorized users could lead to disclosure of sensitive information contained in tracing logs such as keys, access tokens, passwords, internal hostnames, and IP addresses.  
  
Traces generated by Azure API Management service may contain sensitive information that is intended for service owner and should not be exposed to clients using the service. Using tracing enabled subscription keys in production or automated scenarios creates a risk of sensitive information exposure if client making call to the service requests a trace.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Avoiding the use of tracing enabled subscriptions in production scenarios minimizes the risk of inadvertent sensitive information exposure including, but not limited to keys, access tokens, passwords, internal hostnames, and IP addresses.  

**Impact:** High

#### Self-hosted gateway instance(s) were identified that use gateway tokens that will expire soon  
  
At least one deployed self-hosted gateway instance was identified that uses a gateway token that will expire in the next 7 days. To ensure that it can connect to the control-plane, generate a new gateway token and update your deployed self-hosted gateway(s). This doesn't impact data-plane traffic.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ensure deployed gateway(s) use the latest configuration.  

**Impact:** High

#### Use Azure AD-based authentication for more fine-grained control and simplified management  
  
You can use Azure AD-based authentication, instead of gateway tokens, which allows you to use standard procedures to create, assign and manage permissions and control expiry times. Additionally, you gain fine-grained control across gateway deployments and easily revoke access in case of a breach.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Run gateway(s) more securely with simplified management  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Use api-versions newer than 2021-08-01 to manage service configuration  
  
Update your existing templates, tools, scripts, and programs used to configure Azure API Management to 2021-08-01 or later for our latest capabilities and support.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Our newer API versions make your infrastructure more secure, reliable and offers more functionality  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Validate JWT policy is being used with security keys that have insecure key size for validating Json Web Token (JWT).  
  
Validate JWT policy is being used with security keys that have insecure key size for validating Json Web Token (JWT). We recommend using longer key sizes to improve security for JWT-based authentication & authorization.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Improved security of JWT-based authentication & authorization with more robust JWT validation.  

**Impact:** Medium

#### Disable trusted service connectivity in API Management  
  
Your API Management service may rely on trusted service connectivity to access other Azure services. To prevent service disruption following the retirement of this feature in March 2026, update your networking configuration and disable trusted connectivity in API Management.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Prevent runtime outage of APIs in API Management  

**Impact:** High
