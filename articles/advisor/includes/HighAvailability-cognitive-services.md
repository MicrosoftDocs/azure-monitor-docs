#### Upgrade your application to use the latest API version from Azure OpenAI  
  
An Azure OpenAI resource with an older API version lacks the latest features and functionalities. We recommend that you use the latest REST API version.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Our new API versions contain the latest and greatest features and capabilities.  

For more information, see [Azure OpenAI Service REST API reference](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference)

#### Quota exceeded for this resource, wait or upgrade to unblock  
  
If the quota for your resource is exceeded your resource becomes blocked. You can wait for the quota to automatically get replenished soon, or, to use the resource again now, upgrade it to a paid SKU.  
  
**Potential benefits**: If you upgrade to a paid SKU you can use the resource again today.  

For more information, see [Plan and manage costs for Azure AI Foundry](/azure/cognitive-services/plan-manage-costs#pay-as-you-go)
