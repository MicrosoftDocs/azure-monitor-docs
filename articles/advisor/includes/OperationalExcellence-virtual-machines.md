#### In-Place Upgrade to Ubuntu Pro with zero downtime for Extended Security  
  
Given Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is out of standard support, customers are required to upgrade to Ubuntu Pro enable Extended Security Maintenance until 2028. Ubuntu Pro is a premium image delivering the most comprehensive open source security while expanding the package coverage to over 23,000 packages.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Ubuntu Pro enables Extended Security Maintenance until 2028.  

**Impact:** High

#### Enable Trusted Launch foundational excellence, and modern security for Existing Generation 2 VM(s)  
  
Trusted Launch (TL) offers a modern and operational technologies for Azure virtual machines, using Secure Boot, virtual TPM, and guest attestation. This Generation 2 VM(s) have an opportunity to upgrade to Trusted Launch. Ensure this VM(s) has both an image and VM size that it's TL compatible.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Boost Gen2 VM security by protecting against rootkits  

**Impact:** High

#### Add explicit outbound method to disable default outbound for Virtual Machine Scale Sets  
  
Use an explicit connectivity method such as NAT gateway or a Public IP. After March 31, 2026, new virtual networks will default to creation of private subnets, which are intentionally designed to block default outbound access connectivity.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Secure and explicit outbound access for new subnets  

**Impact:** Medium
