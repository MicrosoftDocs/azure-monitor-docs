#### Purchasing a savings plan for compute could unlock lower prices  
  
We analyzed your compute usage over the last 30 days and recommend adding a savings plan to increase your savings. The savings plan unlocks lower prices on select compute services when you commit to spend a fixed hourly amount for 1 or 3 years. As you use select compute services globally, your usage is covered by the plan at reduced prices. During the times when your usage is above your hourly commitment, you'll simply be billed at your regular pay-as-you-go prices. With savings automatically applying across compute usage globally, you'll continue saving even as your usage needs change over time. Savings plan are more suited for dynamic workloads while accommodating for planned or unplanned changes while reservations are more suited for stable, predictable workloads with no planned changes. Saving estimates are calculated for individual subscriptions and the usage pattern observed over last 30 days. Shared scope savings plans are available in purchase experience and can further increase savings.  
  
**Potential benefits**: savings
