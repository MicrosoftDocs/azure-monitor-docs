## Data Factory  
  
<!--f6e3ad9c-5d58-48ba-b06b-ebffba60dd18_begin-->

#### Delete failing ADF pipelines  
  
Repeatedly failing pipelines have been detected in your Azure Data Factory resource. Know that you're being billed for them even though they aren't serving you while failing. Review them to resolve issues or delete failing pipelines that are no longer needed to save on costs.  
  
**Potential benefits**: Reduce billing costs by addressing issues with or deleting your failing Data Factory pipelines  

**Impact:** Medium
