# Resource impact from Azure planned maintenance

In support of the experience for viewing Impacted Resources, Service Health has a new feature to:

- Display resources that are impacted by a planned maintenance event.
- Provide impacted resources information for planned maintenance via the Service Health Portal. 

This article details what is communicated to users and where they can view information about their impacted resources.

>[!Note]
>This feature will be rolled out in phases. Initially, impacted resources will only be shown for **SQL resources with advance customer notifications and rebootful updates for compute resources.** Planned maintenance impacted resources coverage will be expanded to other resource types and scenarios in the future.

## Viewing Impacted Resources for Planned Maintenance Events on the Service Health Portal 

In the Azure portal, the **Impacted Resources** tab under **Service Health** > **Planned Maintenance** displays resources affected by a planned maintenance event. The following example of the Impacted Resources tab shows a planned maintenance event with impacted resources.
