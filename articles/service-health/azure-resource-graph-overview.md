# Azure Resource Graph tables overview

Azure Resource Graph (ARG) provides a way for you to query Azure resources across your subscriptions using Kusto Query Language (KQL). 
This article gives a detailed breakdown of the fields commonly found in ARG tables, especially the fields that are relevant to Azure Service Health and governance scenarios.

Use the Service Health table to query:
-  Service Health Event properties (microsoft.resourcehealth/events)
-  Service Health Impacted Resources properties (microsoft.resourcehealth/events/impactedresources)<br>

Use the Resource Health table to query:
-  Resource Health properties (microsoft.resourcehealth/availabilitystatuses and microsoft.resourcehealth/resourceannotations)<br>
For more information on the HealthResources table, see [VM availability information in Azure Resource Graph](/azure/virtual-machines/resource-graph-availability/).

## Service Health

The **ServiceHealthResources** queries returns data about resources within your subscriptions that are affected by service health events.<br>

These notifications are a subclass of activity log events and can also be found in the [Azure activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log). <br>

Depending on the event classification, **EventType** and **EventSubtype** service health notifications could be either informational or actionable.


### Service Health Event properties (microsoft.resourcehealth/events)


:::image type="content"source="./media/resource-graph-overview/service-health-properties.png"alt-text="Screenshot of the fields shown in the Service Health properties column."Lightbox="./media/resource-graph-overview/service-health-properties.png":::

The values in the `properties` field are used for querying Azure Service Health events.

There are some common properties that exist across all the different event types, but everything under `properties` should be considered dynamic based on the event type.<br>

These fields are used together to track, filter, and analyze service health events across your Azure environment. <br>For example, you can query for all `Critical ServiceIssue` events in a specific location that are still `Active`.

This table lists all the properties you can use in your Service Health and Impacted Resources queries.


|Property                         |Description                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

>[!NOTE]
>The "properties" structure is dynamic and varies by EventType and EventSubType. Not all fields are present in every event.<br>
>Fields like `isEventSensitive` might be empty or omitted unless the event is security-related.<br> 
>The `EventSubType` is often empty unless the event is a billing or retirement advisory. <br>For more information, see [Service Health event tags](service-health-event-tags.md) and [Filter notifications using Event Level](/azure/service-health/metadata-filter).

Access control should be utilized to ensure only users who need to see the data are able to access it. For more information, see [View and access Security advisories](security-advisories-elevated-access.md).

**How These Fields Work Together**

- **Governance & Monitoring**: Combine `EventType`, `Severity`, and `Status` that monitors ongoing issues and assess their impact.
- **Filtering & Alerting**: Use `SubscriptionId`, and `Impact` that filters events relevant to specific teams or workloads.
- **Historical Analysis**: Use `ImpactStartTime` and `ImpactMitigationTime` to understand event timelines and Service Level Agreement (SLA) implications.
- **REST API Integration**: These fields are exposed through the [Azure Service Health REST API](/events/list-by-subscription-id), allowing programmatic access and automation.
- **Filter and Scope Events**: `SubscriptionId`, `Impact`, `TrackingId`, and `PlatformInitiated` help narrow down which resources are affected and how.
- **Track and Analyze**: `LastUpdateTime`, `Header`, and `EventTags` support monitoring and historical analysis.
- **Support Financial and Compliance Workflows**: `BillingId` and `CurrencyType` are essential for billing-related events and audits.


## Impacted Resources
:::image type="content"source="./media/resource-graph-overview/impacted-resources-properties.png"alt-text="Screenshot of the fields shown in the Impacted Resources properties column."Lightbox="./media/resource-graph-overview/impacted-resources-properties.png":::

When the `type` column in the ServiceHealthResources table is set to **microsoft.resourcehealth/events/impactedresources** it opens the query to search for information about the impacted resources by Service Health events such as outages, planned maintenance, or security advisories.


### Impacted Resources properties

|Field name           |Description |
|---------------------|---------|
|`resourceName`       | Name of the impacted resource         |
|`resourceGroupName`  | Name of Resource Group        |
|`targetResourceType` | Type of the impacted resource         |
|`targetResourceId`   | Full resource ID |
|`targetRegion`       | Region of the impacted resource        |

|`maintenanceStartTime`  |When the event causing the impact began  |
|`maintenanceEndTime`  |When the event causing the impact ended  |
|`targetResourceType`  | Type of the impacted resource (for example, Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines) |
|`targetResourceId`  | Full resource ID of the impacted resource  |
|`resourceGroup`  |Name of the Resource Group  |
|`targetRegion`  |Region of the impacted resource  |
|`staus`  |Current status of the event  |
|`info`  |  |


## Resource Health

The **HealthResources** table in Azure Resource Graph (ARG) provides detailed information about the health status of your Azure resources, especially virtual machines. 



### HealthResources properties

:::image type="content"source="./media/resource-graph-overview/resource-health-properties.png"alt-text="Screenshot of the fields shown in the Resource Health properties column."Lightbox="./media/resource-graph-overview/resource-health-properties.png":::

These fields provide the actual health information:

|Property                    |Description                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`availabilityState`            | Current health status: Available, Unavailable, or Degraded                           |
|`previousAvailabilityState`    | Previous health status before the current state                                      |
|`reasonType`                   | Reason for the current health state (for instance, PlatformInitiated, UserInitiated) |
|`reasonChronicityType`         | Indicates whether the issue is Persistent or Transient                               |
|`annotationName`               | Descriptive label for the health event (for example, VirtualMachineRestarted)        |
|`title`                        | Title of the Health event                                                            |
|`summary`                      | Summary of the health event                                                          |
|`impactStartTime`              | Timestamp when the event began                                                       |

**How These Fields Work Together**

- **Monitoring & Alerting**: `availabilityState`, `reasonType`, and `impactStartTime` help identify and respond to outages or degradations.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: `reasonChronicityType`, `annotationName`, and `summary` provide context for troubleshooting.
- **Governance & Reporting**: `location`, `subscriptionId`, and `resourceGroup` allow filtering and aggregation across environments.
- **Automation**: `recommendedActions` can be used to trigger automated remediation workflows.

## Troubleshooting

**Question**<br>
Why are the `maintenanceStartTime`, `maintenanceEndTime`, and `info` showing as null in my ARG query results?<br>
**Answer**<br>
These fields can appear null in ARG queries for microsoft.resourcehealth events due to several factors. Understanding the fields can help you interpret the data more accurately.
-  **Event type dependency**:<br>
Only Planned Maintenance events include maintenance timing details. Other event types like Service Issue or Security Advisory don't use those fields, so they're null.
- **Incomplete ingestion data**: Sometimes the upstream ingestion pipeline from Azure Change Management or partners might not populate the maintenance timing fields, especially during rapid incident responses or edge cases.
- **Event lifecycle and access control**:<br>
    - Newly created or early-stage events might not have the full details to populate the fields or confirmed maintenance windows. 
    - Some sensitive events require elevated permissions to view complete data. Without the right access, the fields appear blank.
- **Event history and recommendations**:
    - Filter for PlannedMaintenance events.
    - Confirm your role and access permissions.
    - Check the event status.
    - Report any consistent data gaps through the appropriate support channels.
