# Resource Health virtual machine Health Annotations

Virtual Machine (VM) health annotations let you know when something is happening that could affect your VM’s availability. The annotations include details that help explain exactly what the impact is and why it’s happening. See [Resource types and health checks](resource-health-checks-resource-types.md)

## Overview

This page identifies the key attributes that help explain the annotations you might see in [Resource Health](resource-health-overview.md), [Azure Resource Graph](/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview), and [Event Grid System](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-health-resources?tabs=event-grid-event-schema) articles. Each annotation includes:


- **Context**: 
    - This attribute tells you who initiated the event and if the VM availability was influenced due to Azure or user orchestrated activity. 
    - The values can be:<br>
        - Platform Initiated 
        - Customer Initiated 
        - VM Initiated 
        - Unknown
- **Category**: 
    - This attribute indicates if the availability of the VM is influenced by planned or unplanned activity. It's only applicable to `Platform-Initiated` events. 
    - The values can be:<br>
        - Planned
        - Unplanned
        - Not Applicable
        - Unknown
- **ImpactType**: 
    - This attribute shows the type of impact to VM availability. 
    - The values can be:<br>
        - *Downtime Reboot or Downtime Freeze*:  
            - This type lets you know when a VM is Unavailable due to Azure orchestrated activity (for example, VirtualMachineStorageOffline, LiveMigrationSucceeded etc.).<br> The reboot or freeze distinction can help you discern the type of downtime impact faced.
        - *Degraded*: 
            - This type indicates when Azure predicts a hardware (HW) failure on the host server or detects a potential degradation in performance (for example, VirtualMachinePossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailure).
        - *Informational*: 
            - Informs when an authorized user or process triggers a control plane operation (for example, VirtualMachineDeallocationInitiated, VirtualMachineRestarted). This category also captures cases of platform actions due to customer defined thresholds or conditions (for example, VirtualMachinePreempted).



>[!Note]
> A VMs availability impact start and end time is **only** applicable to degraded annotations, and does not apply to downtime or informational annotations.
## Table of annotations

This table contains a list of all the annotations and a summary of each one on the platform.


| Annotation | Description | Attributes |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| PossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailureWithRedeployDeadline |The Physical Host on which your Virtual Machine is running has potentially degraded. Live Migration, if applicable, is performed as the best effort to safely migrate your Virtual Machine. We strongly recommend redeploying your Virtual Machine before the specified redeployment deadline to avoid unexpected disruptions.|  <ul><li>**Context**: Platform Initiated<li>**Category**: Unplanned<li>**ImpactType**: Degraded |
| VirtualMachineRestarted    | The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot as requested by a restart action triggered by an authorized user or process from within the Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine reboots in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot). | <ul><li>**Context**: Customer Initiated<li>**Category**: Not Applicable<li>**ImpactType**: Informational |
| VirtualMachineCrashed | The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot due to a guest OS crash. The local data remains unaffected during this process. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine crashes in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot#vm-crashes). | <ul><li>**Context**: VM Initiated<li>**Category**: Not Applicable<li>**ImpactType**: Downtime Reboot |
| VirtualMachineStorageOffline | The Virtual Machine is either currently undergoing a reboot or experiencing an application freeze due to a temporary loss of access to disk.

| VirtualMachineFailedToSecureBoot | Applicable to Azure Confidential Compute Virtual Machines when guest activity such as unsigned booting components lead to a guest OS issue preventing the Virtual Machine from booting securely. You can attempt to retry deployment after ensuring trusted publishers sign the OS boot components. For more information, see [Secure Boot](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot). | <ul><li> **Context**: Customer Initiated<li>**Category**: Not Applicable<li>**ImpactType**: Informational |
| LiveMigrationSucceeded | The Virtual Machine was briefly paused as a Live Migration operation was successfully performed on your Virtual Machine. This operation was carried out either as a repair action, for allocation optimization or as part of routine maintenance workflows. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [Live Migration](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates#live-migration). | <ul><li> **Context**: Platform Initiated<li>**Category**: Unplanned<li>**ImpactType**: Downtime Freeze | 
| LiveMigrationFailure | A Live Migration operation was attempted on your Virtual Machine as either a repair action, for allocation optimization or as part of routine maintenance workflows. This operation, however, couldn't be successfully completed and might result in a brief pause of your Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. <br/> Also note that [M Series](/azure/virtual-machines/m-series), [L Series](/azure/virtual-machines/lasv3-series) VM SKUs aren't applicable for Live Migration. For more information, see [Live Migration](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates#live-migration). | <ul><li> **Context**: Platform Initiated<li>**Category**: Unplanned<li>**ImpactType**: Downtime Freeze |
