# Resource Health virtual machine Health Annotations

Virtual Machine (VM) health annotations inform any ongoing activity that influences the availability of VMs (see [Resource types and health checks](resource-health-checks-resource-types.md)). Annotations carry metadata that help rationalize the exact impact to availability. 

Here are more details on important attributes recently added to help understand below annotations you might observe in [Resource Health](resource-health-overview.md), [Azure Resource Graph](/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) and [Event Grid System](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-health-resources?tabs=event-grid-event-schema) topics:

- **Context**: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to Azure or user orchestrated activity. It can assume values of _Platform Initiated | Customer Initiated | VM Initiated | Unknown_
- **Category**: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to planned or unplanned activity and is only applicable to `Platform-Initiated` events. It can assume values of _Planned | Unplanned | Not Applicable | Unknown_
- **ImpactType**: Informs the type of impact to VM availability. It can assume values of:

    - *Downtime Reboot or Downtime Freeze*:  Informs when VM is Unavailable due to Azure orchestrated activity (for example, VirtualMachineStorageOffline, LiveMigrationSucceeded etc.). The reboot or freeze distinction can help you discern the type of downtime impact faced.
    - *Degraded*: Informs when Azure predicts a HW failure on the host server or detects potential degradation in performance. (for example, VirtualMachinePossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailure)
    - *Informational*: Informs when an authorized user or process triggers a control plane operation (for example, VirtualMachineDeallocationInitiated, VirtualMachineRestarted). This category also captures cases of platform actions due to customer defined thresholds or conditions. (for example, VirtualMachinePreempted)

>[!Note]
> A VMs availability impact start and end time is **only** applicable to degraded annotations, and does not apply to downtime or informational annotations.

The below table summarizes all the annotations that the platform emits today:


| Annotation | Description | Attributes |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| PossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailureWithRedeployDeadline | The Physical Host on which your Virtual Machine is running has potentially degraded. Live Migration, if applicable, will be attempted as best effort to safely migrate your Virtual Machine. We strongly recommend redeploying your Virtual Machine before the specified redeployment deadline to avoid unexpected disruptions. |  <ul><li>**Context**: Platform Initiated<li>**Category**: Unplanned<li>**ImpactType**: Degraded |
| VirtualMachineRestarted    | The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot as requested by a restart action triggered by an authorized user or process from within the Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine reboots in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot). | <ul><li>**Context**: Customer Initiated<li>**Category**: Not Applicable<li>**ImpactType**: Informational |
| VirtualMachineCrashed | The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot due to a guest OS crash. The local data remains unaffected during this process. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine crashes in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot#vm-crashes). | <ul><li>**Context**: VM Initiated<li>**Category**: Not Applicable<li>**ImpactType**: Downtime Reboot |
| VirtualMachineStorageOffline | The Virtual Machine is either currently undergoing a reboot or experiencing an application freeze due to a temporary loss of access to disk. No other action is required at this time, while the platform is working on reestablishing disk connectivity. | <ul><li>**Context**: Platform Initiated<li>**Category**: Unplanned<li>**ImpactType**: Downtime Reboot |
| VirtualMachineFailedToSecureBoot | Applicable to Azure Confidential Compute Virtual Machines when guest activity such as unsigned booting components leads to a guest OS issue preventing the Virtual Machine from booting securely. You can attempt to retry deployment after ensuring OS boot components are signed by trusted publishers. For more information, see [Secure Boot](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot). | <ul><li> **Context**: Customer Initiated<li>**Category**: Not Applicable<li>**ImpactType**: Informational |
| LiveMigrationSucceeded | The Virtual Machine was briefly paused as a Live Migration operation was successfully performed on your Virtual Machine. This operation was carried out either as a repair action, for allocation optimization or as part of routine maintenance workflows. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [Live Migration](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates#live-migration). | <ul><li> **Context**: Platform Initiated<li>**Category**: Unplanned<li>**ImpactType**: Downtime Freeze | 
| LiveMigrationFailure | A Live Migration operation was attempted on your Virtual Machine as either a repair action, for allocation optimization or as part of routine maintenance workflows. This operation, however, couldn't be successfully completed and may have resulted in a brief pause of your Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. <br/> Also note that [M Series](/azure/virtual-machines/m-series), [L Series](/azure/virtual-machines/lasv3-series) VM SKUs aren't applicable for Live Migration.
