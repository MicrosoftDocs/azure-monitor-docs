# Resource impact from Azure outages

[Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started/azure-portal/service-health/) helps customers monitor any health events that affect their subscriptions and tenants. In the Azure portal, the **Service Issues** pane within **Service Health** displays any ongoing problems in Azure services that are affecting your resources. You can see when each issue began and which services and regions are impacted. 

This article details what Service Health communicates and where you can view information about your impacted resources.

### View impacted resources

In the Azure portal, the **Impacted Resources** tab under **Service Health** > **Service Issues** displays resources that are or might be impacted by an outage. Service Health provides the below information to users whose resources are impacted by an outage:

|Column  |Description |
|---------|---------|
|**Resource Name**|Name of the resource. This name is a clickable link that goes to the Resource Health page to show the resource. If no Resource Health signal is available for the resource, this name is text only.|
|**Resource Health**|Health status of the resource: <br><br>**Available**: Your resource is healthy, but a service event might have impacted it at a previous point in time. <br><br>**Degraded** or **Unavailable**: A customer-initiated action or a platform-initiated action might have caused this status. It means your resource was impacted but might now be healthy, pending a status update. <br><br>:::image type="content" source="./media/impacted-resource-outage/rh-cropped.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of health statuses for a resource.":::|
|**Impact Type**|Indication of whether the resource is or might be impacted: <br><br>**Confirmed**: The resource is confirmed to be impacted by an outage. Check the **Summary** section for any action items that you can take to remediate the problem. <br><br>**Potential**: The resource is not confirmed to be impacted, but it could potentially be impacted because it's under a service or region that an outage is affecting. Check the **Resource Health** column to make sure that everything is working as planned.|
|**Resource Type**|Type of impacted resource (for example, virtual machine).|
|**Resource Group**|Resource group that contains the impacted resource.|
|**Location**|Location that contains the impacted resource.|
|**Subscription ID**|Unique ID for the subscription that contains the impacted resource.|
|**Subscription Name**|Subscription name for the subscription that contains the impacted resource.|

The following is an example of outage **Impacted Resources** from the subscription and tenant scope.

>[!Note]
>Not all resources in subscription scope will show a Resource Health status. The status appears only on resources for which a Resource Health signal is available. The status of resources for which a Resource Health signal is not available appears as **N/A**, and the corresponding **Resource Name** value is text instead of a clickable link.

:::image type="content" source="./media/impacted-resource-outage/ir-tenant.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of information about tenant impacted resources in Azure Service Health.":::

>[!Note]
>Resource Health status, tenant name, and tenant ID are not included at the tenant level scope. The corresponding **Resource Name** value is text only instead of a clickable link.

### Filter results

You can adjust the results by using these filters:

- **Impact type**: Select **Confirmed** or **Potential**.
- **Subscription ID**: Show all subscription IDs that the user can access.
- **Status**: Focus on Resource Health status by selecting **Available**, **Unavailable**, **Degraded**, **Unknown**, or **N/A**.

### Export to CSV

To export the list of impacted resources to an Excel file, select the **Export to CSV** option.

### Access impacted resources programmatically via an API

You can get information about outage-impacted resources programmatically by using the Events API. For details on how to access this data, see [API documentation](/rest/api/resourcehealth/2022-10-01/impacted-resources).
