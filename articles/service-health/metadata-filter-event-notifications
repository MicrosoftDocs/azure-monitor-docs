# Use Service Health to filter event notifications

## Overview
Given the volume of Service Health event communications, the Event Level field now includes metadata that offers supplementary details. 
This improvement enables users to quickly assess the importance of each alert. 
With this new feature, clients can filter and sort events based on this metadata, allowing them to prioritize their actions more efficiently.

## Who can see the Metadata fields
Anyone who has access to the subscription as a reader can view and filter by Event Level.

## Event Level Alert definitions
### Event Level for Service Issues
|title|Definition|
|-----|-----|
|**Informational**|No current service availability impact, but possible future issues in a specific region.|
|**Warning**|Potential service issues in a region that could impact availability or performance if high availability or disaster recovery is not used, or the issue persists.|
|**Critical**|Immediate attention recommended. Widespread issues affecting multiple regions or services, risking failure of high availability or disaster recovery measures.|

>[!Tip:] You can filter by Metadata to see specific types using the 'Event Level' field.

>[!NOTE:] This is only available for Service Issues.
