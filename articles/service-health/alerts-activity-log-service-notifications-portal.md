# Create Service Health alerts using the Azure portal

## Overview

This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to configure alerts for Azure Service Health notifications through the Azure portal.  

Service Health notifications are stored in the [Azure activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md). Given the large volume of information stored in the activity log, there's a separate user interface to make it easier to view and set up alerts on service health notifications. 

**Key Features**

- Alerts are based on the type of notification, affected subscription, services, and regions.
- They're created using the Azure portalâ€™s Service Health interface.
- You can choose or create an "action group" to define who receives the alert.
- Alerts are only supported in public clouds within the global region.
- Advanced options allow for more detailed configurations, including webhook notifications for integration with external systems.

 You can receive an alert when Azure sends Service Health notifications to your Azure subscription. You can configure the alert based on

- The class of service health notification (Service issues, Planned maintenance, Health advisories, Security advisories)
- The subscription that is affected
- The services that are affected
- The regions that are affected

> [!NOTE]
> Service Health notifications don't send alerts for resource health events.

You also can configure who the alert should be sent to:

- Select an existing action group.
- Create a new action group (that can be used for future alerts).
> [!NOTE]
> Service Health Alerts are only supported in public clouds within the global region. For Action Groups to properly function in response to a Service Health Alert, the region of the action group must be set as "Global."

To learn more about action groups, see [Create and manage action groups](../azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups.md).

For information on how to configure service health notification alerts by using Azure Resource Manager templates, see [Resource Manager templates](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-activity-log.md).
