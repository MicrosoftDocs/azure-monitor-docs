# What's new in Azure Service Health service

This article lists recent changes in the Azure Service Health service. 

## New Metadata information
In February 2025, there's a new field called Event Level which indicates the significance of each communication in Service Health Communications. 
You can use this field to sort events. See [Service Health Event Level Filter notifications](metadata-filter.md)



## What's coming

### Azure Co-Pilot for Microsoft in Service Health
You can use Azure Co-Pilot for Microsoft to find outage details, ask questions about subscriptions and resources, and access more details about outages through links to the service health portal. 

### In-portal Billing communications
There will be new Billing communication events available in-portal for subscribers to find more information about their billing events such as overbilling, underbilling, price changes, etc.

### New Communication Event tags
