# What's new in Azure Service Health service

This article lists recent changes in the Azure Service Health service.

## New metadata information

As of February 2025, there's a new **Event Level** metadata field. This new field indicates the significance of each communication in Service Health communications. You can use this field to sort events. See [Service Health event-level filter notifications](metadata-filter.md)

## In-portal billing communications

There are new billing communication events available in the Service Health portal. Subscribers can use these communications to find more information about their billing events, including overbilling, underbilling, price changes, and more. See [In-Portal billing communications](billing-elevated-access.md).

## Microsoft Copilot in Azure in Service Health

You can now use Microsoft Copilot in Azure to find outage details, ask questions about subscriptions and resources, and access more details about outages through links to the Service Health portal.

See [Understand Service Health events and status by using Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/understand-service-health).

## New communication event tags are coming soon

There will be new metadata tags for communication events to filter through the Service Health events in the portal.
