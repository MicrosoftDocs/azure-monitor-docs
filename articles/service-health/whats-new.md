# What's new in Azure Service Health service

This article lists recent changes in the Azure Service Health service. 

## New Metadata information
In February 2025, there's a new field called Event Level which indicates the significance of each communication in Service Health Communications. 
You can use this field to sort events. See [Service Health Event Level Filter notifications](metadata-filter.md)

## In-portal Billing communications
There are new Billing communication events available in-portals for subscribers to find more information about their billing events such as overbilling, underbilling, price changes, etc. <br>
See [In-Portal Billing Communications](billing-elevated-access.md).

## Azure Copilot for Microsoft in Service Health
You can now use Azure Copilot for Microsoft to find outage details, ask questions about subscriptions and resources, and access more details about outages through links to the service health portal. 
<br>See [Understand service health events and status using Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/understand-service-health.md).


## What's coming

### New Communication Event tags
There will be new metadata tags for communication events to filter through the service health events in the portal.
