# Overview of Azure operations center (preview)

Azure operations center is a unified operations management platform designed to streamline monitoring, troubleshooting, and automation across cloud and hybrid environments. It allows you to retain your existing investments in Azure management tools, such as Azure Monitor and Defender for cloud, while consolidating the configuration and administration of these services into a common portal, enhanced by agentic workflows powered by Copilot. 

## Key Features
- Unified dashboard for operational data
- Agentic experience for guided troubleshooting
- Integration with Azure Monitor and other tools
- Scalable onboarding and licensing management

## Audience
Ops360 is intended for IT operations teams, cloud administrators, and service owners seeking to improve efficiency and visibility across their environments.

## Operations pillars
Operations center is organized into five pillars that correspond to the [pillars in Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/pillars).

| Observability | Provides a deep understanding of a system to diagnose and resolve unknown or complex problems. | [Azure Monitor]()<br>[Service health]() |
| Security | Protect systems and data. | [Defender for Cloud ]() |
| Configuration | Defining standards, assessing compliance, and changing the settings of a system. | [Business continuity center]()<br>[Backup]()<br>[Site Recovery]() |
| Resiliency | Emphasizes the systems ability to recover from failures and maintain functionality | [Policy]()<br>[Machine configuration]()<br>[Update management]()<br>[Change tracking + inventory]() | 
| Optimization | Finds the best possible solution within given constraints, improving factors like cost, performance, and carbon emissions. | [Cost optimization]()<br>[Carbon emissions]() |
