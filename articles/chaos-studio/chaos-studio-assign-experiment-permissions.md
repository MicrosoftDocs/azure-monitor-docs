# Assigning experiment permissions in Azure Chaos Studio

Proper assignment of permissions is an essential part of configuring your experiments successfully in Azure Chaos Studio. Chaos experiments use managed identities to obtain the necessary permissions to inject faults on experiment targets. You can use Azure built-in roles or a custom role to assign the right permissions to your experiment's managed identity. When creating or editing your experiments in the Azure portal, you may use Chaos Studio's automatic role assignment functionality to assign, check, or update your experiment permissions easily.
