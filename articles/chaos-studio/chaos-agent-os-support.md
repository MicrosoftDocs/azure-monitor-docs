# Chaos Agent Version Compatibility

The following compatibility matrix outlines the officially supported operating systems for the Azure Chaos Studio Agent, along with the minimum supported version and the fault support from our agent fault library. In the fault columns, a check (✓) indicates full support, "✓ (outbound)" denotes that only outbound support is provided, and an "✗" means the fault isn't supported on that operating system.

## Manual Package Dependencies for specific operating systems

While the agent may autoinstall some dependencies on certain mainstream Linux operating systems, you might need to install the following packages manually on certain operating systems due to limitations or other required configurations:

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```sudo apt-get install stress-ng unzip```

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS:
 

```sudo yum install stress-ng```


### openSUSE / Oracle Linux:
 

```sudo zypper install stress-ng```


### Azure Linux (Mariner):

```sudo tdnf install stress-ng```

---

## Hardening standards

### Linux hardening 

The agent isn't currently tested against custom Linux distributions or hardened Linux distributions (for example, FIPS or SELinux).

---
## Unlisted operating systems

If an operating system isn't currently listed, you may still attempt to install, use, and troubleshoot the virtual machine extension, agent, and agent-based capabilities, but Chaos Studio can't guarantee behavior or support for an unlisted operating system.
